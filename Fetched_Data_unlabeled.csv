‘genocide’",https://www.sunjournal.com/2024/05/05/rich-lowry-no-columbia-isnt-complicit-in-genocide/,sunjournal,https://www.sunjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2023/10/Rich-Lowry1-1698409442.jpg,rich lowry as morningside heights goes so goes the levant this is the childishly self dramatizing conceit that been driving the pro hamas protests at columbia university with similar ideas playing into protests elsewhere it allows students living privileged lives at elite universities to believe that they are on the front lines of fighting so called genocide and what happens at their schools and to them is exciting dangerous and determinative of geopolitical events half world away this is not to say that what happening at columbia isn important to columbia in terms of who really in charge and whether the rules apply to pro hamas protestors or not but that doesn match the world historical significance that the students want to attribute to their sloganeering and sleepovers according to the statement issued by columbia protestors at the outset of this episode israel has undertaken brutal onslaught against the palestinian people for 75 years that is enabled by financial investments made by institutions like columbia university the israeli palestinian dispute has been focus of international attention intense news coverage and extensive academic research for decades now and yet no one to this point has realized columbia role in multiple wars terror attacks and refugee crises has anyone in the middle east ever paused before taking decision to ask what does president minouche shafik think so how does columbia pull the strings in conflict that to the uninitiated seems to be function of the priorities of major geopolitical players in the region and around the world well the columbia students claim the university weaponization of policy to silence students enables the atrocities that israel has subjected palestinians to for decades as if israel pursuit of the war in gaza depends on whether there an illegal pro hamas encampment at columbia or not ah and then there the influence of columbia university emails the columbia administration the students complain has set dangerous precedent by erasing the palestinian struggle through one sided decisions and emails that threaten and suppress the voices of students who support justice for palestine actually the palestinian struggle isn subject to erasure by anything anyone says or does at columbia and even if the decisions and emails are indeed for the sake of argument one sided that doesn suppress or threaten anyone this is safe spacism on behalf of people who want to violate the rules with impunity in the course of supporting hideous terror group the threatening nature of those decisions and emails though can be underestimated according to the students they supposedly are enabling violent repressive environment that puts palestinian students as well as all their arab muslim jewish and bipoc peers at risk through surveillance and policing if only columbia cared about the fate of its bipoc students enough to issue less one sided emails and who ultimately behind this potential repression yes the zionist entity we reject the students intone the violence of the israel defense forces trained police industrial complex that chokes our communities and disproportionately enacts brutality against people of color at the core of the case that columbia is complicit in genocide relies on the old bds agenda that demands that israel be treated as an apartheid state and attributes moral responsibility for israel supposed sins to any institution that doesn divest this campaign is based on lie about the nature of israeli society that aside the idea that columbia is responsible for the gaza war because index funds it invests in might own shares in israeli solar or high tech firms is preposterous of course the larger point is that people who won condemn terror group or the horrific pogrom it carried out on oct 7 who never demand that hamas release its hostages who single out for condemnation democratic society beset by profoundly illiberal forces all around it are presuming to lecture everyone else about complicity to the extent that they really are engaged in great moral struggle they are on the wrong side rich lowry is syndicated columnist success please wait

2,1c2eadcf72d7c808d302ce2292160e38,How using ‘high dominance’ rhetoric can help Biden beat Trump,https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/4643247-how-using-high-dominance-rhetoric-can-help-biden-beat-trump/,thehill,https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/GettyImages-1948404011.jpg?w=900,the 2024 presidential election appears to be about half of all voters want to replace both biden and trump on the ballot but party loyalty among rank and file republicans and democrats remains strong and the bases are dug in political psychologist drew westen has that democrats reconsider their view that elections are won and lost on the issues and the assumption that the policies they support sell themselves politics westen emphasizes is actually less marketplace of ideas than marketplace of emotions and feelings are best tapped through stories that fit into master narrative if democrats don adopt this approach he they can only hope for default victories that occur when the republicans are so incompetent corrupt or morally bankrupt that voters have no direction to turn but left and maybe not even then new unabashedly partisan by steven fish professor of political science at the university of california berkeley builds on westen analysis comeback routing trumpism reclaiming the nation and restoring democracy edge proposes an approach to campaign messaging that should command the attention of democratic strategists and political junkies across the ideological spectrum fish makes compelling case that voters admire respect and support politicians who consistently use high dominance rhetoric while acknowledging that such rhetoric can be liability when taken to extremes maga republicans especially donald trump tend to savor conflict shape their own reality use entertaining provocative language cast themselves as buoyant confident menacing and morally superior and their opponents as weak underhanded unpatriotic and worthy of ridicule and contempt these figures provide voters with perpetual reminders of the truth their truth when caught in lies they double down rather than revise or retract by contrast liberal democrats including joe biden tend to be introspective and empathetic endorse bipartisanship and compromise play defense and present themselves and their constituents as vulnerable they sometimes fear that celebrating progress especially with respect to race ethnicity and gender can be interpreted as insensitivity to those who still suffer the libs don enjoy being owned but they seem uncertain what to do about it most important perhaps the republicans play to win while the democrats play not to lose they call republicans bullies fish writes but leave them in charge of the playground when one political party intentionally deepens social and political cleavages fish maintains the other party must adopt high dominance response although uniting and not dividing is laudable goal the smart strategy is to decisively and repeatedly defeat the polarizers then offer them unity albeit with non negotiable demand that democracy be respected fish notes that 73 percent of americans patriotism is important to them higher percentage than say marriage having children or believing in god is important 56 percent including most working class whites and first generation s citizens the term applies to the gop while only 46 percent believe it applies to the democrats with these attitudes in mind fish urges liberal politicians to stop implying or asserting that the country is site of wrongs that need to be righted and assuming that culture is republicans terrain instead liberals should proclaim their faith in the nation inexhaustible promise with absolutely no reservations doing so he argues allows democrats to contrast their inclusive nationalism which welcomes everyone who pledges allegiance to america revolutionary experiment in democracy with maga exclusionist un american white identity politics he urges democrats to tell stories about the american dream that present equal opportunity for traditionally underprivileged groups as inseparable from the progress of the entire nation describe economic justice in language that celebrates americans enterprising spirit bootstrap mentality and belief in personal responsibility and the united states as the promoter and protector of freedom against the likes of putin xi kim jong un and iranian ayatollahs this nationalist master narrative fish emphasizes can contain claims that republicans not america have made it more difficult to attack poverty confront climate change address voter suppression enact universal background checks on gun purchases and ban the sale of assault weapons the narrative could conclude la ronald reagan with promise of glorious tomorrow and call to action will democratic leaders implement these recommendations if they do the delivery of the messages will be important and as fish recognizes require at minimum reasonably high dominance actor able to generate elation about the nation and engage in spirited and emotional appeals and attacks without alienating base supporters is president biden up to the task given his recent speeches he just might be ,"['glenncaltschuler,opinioncontributor']",99

alarming article in the wall street journal 1 recently reported growing number of people using their retirement accounts like cash machines even to cover emergencies about quarter of 401 account owners who do tap their funds prematurely borrow an average of 11 of their account assets and even if roughly 90 of those borrowers pay the loans back on time 1 in 10 will struggle to do so or simply never pay the money back today article discusses why you should always resist the urge to take early withdrawals from your 401 either through loans or hardship distributions retirement plans use incentives and penalties specifically designed to keep you from tapping your nest egg until later in life contributions to traditional 401 plan are made with pre tax dollars meaning if you have retirement plan at work you never see the money contributed to your account it deducted from payroll before you get your paycheck advertisement however if you take withdrawals from these traditional accounts the irs will require you to pay income tax on the full amount plus often 10 early withdrawal penalty if you are age 591 2 or younger it a strong incentive not to use this money before you retire rules on loans and hardship withdrawals are designed to discourage early withdrawals despite the stiff penalties for taking money out early most 401 plans allow you to borrow up to 50 of your vested balance to limit of 50 000 and for up to five years on the surface it seems like great deal funds can be used for any reason and because the funds are borrowed and not withdrawn the loan is tax free even better you re allowed to repay the loan gradually including both principal and interest and you pay the principal and interest to yourself often at lower rates than you can get at bank if this sounds too good to be true it is we ll explain why in minute the irs also allows withdrawals for hardship related reasons such as preventing evictions paying medical and educational expenses or becoming permanently disabled hardship loans are marginally better than traditional loans because they do not need to be repaid but they do have their own set of rules for example the amount of the withdrawal is limited to the amount necessary to satisfy that need in addition you ll be taxed on the amount withdrawn unless withdrawals are made from after tax roth contributions finally you won be able to roll the distribution amount over to an ira or another plan advertisement the bipartisan budget act of 2018 and secure act 2 0 relaxed some of the rules around taking hardship loans and that in part has made them more popular as sources of emergency cash from tax perspective taking loan from your 401 is inefficient for one thing you must pay the loan back with after tax dollars this means repayment will cost you more than your original contributions for example if you re in the 24 tax bracket every dollar you earn to repay your loan leaves you with only 76 cents for that purpose the rest goes to income tax furthermore if you take loan you lose the earnings on your money while it outside the account creating huge opportunity cost if the return on your 401 balance is 8 for year in which you borrowed funds for example the effective interest on your loan is 8 that an expensive loan should you lose your job you ll have to repay the loan more rapidly generally by the due date of your next tax return when you already could be financially vulnerable finally if you default on the loan repayment the amount you still owe converts to withdrawal and income tax and possible penalties will be due one of the reasons the use of hardship loans has increased is that more employers to improve retirement security for their workers are auto enrolling them into the plans this means worker must opt out of their plan if they don want to save for retirement the positive effect is that workers immediately begin to build nest egg without thinking about it advertisement on the other side some participants often don take the time to understand the rules and penalties that come with participating in workplace plan and view their 401 as ready source of cash in fact according to data from vanguard 3 6 of its plan participants took early withdrawals from their accounts in 2023 for financial emergencies up from pre pandemic average of about 2 this is not to minimize the very real hardships people were facing in 2022 and 2023 everyday costs of gas and groceries were going up and credit card debt began to rise significantly nearly 40 of those who took hardship distributions last year did so to avoid foreclosure 4 more than 75 of hardship distributions totaled 5 000 or less in way the success that 401 plans have recently enjoyed in getting more people to save and invest through auto enrollment is sowing the seeds of potential long term crisis the retirement savings gap is proving stubbornly difficult to close unless it their only recourse we advise most people against taking loan from their 401 people think they will pay back the loan later but in our experience it rarely happens the tax consequences of paying loan back with after tax money erode the value of your hard earned retirement savings and potentially put you on the sidelines while you service the loan moreover taking loan could be red flag that you are living beyond your means and need to consider changes to your lifestyle better approach to the nuclear loan option is to build more liquid emergency fund that will pay for six months or more of living expenses leaving your retirement fund to build long term wealth where it needed for your retirement the opinions voiced in this material are for general information only and are not intended to provide specific advice or

fronts,https://www.mcall.com/2024/05/05/letters-bethlehem-church-housing-proposal-falls-short-on-several-fronts/,mcall,https://www.mcall.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/TMC-TEXAS-IMMIG-LEGAL-10_185729852.jpg?w=1400px&strip=all,the first presbyterian church of bethlehem has recently proposed mixed income housing on their 32 acre property the church has emphasized its commitment to providing affordable housing community building and connectivity there is significant opposition to this project from bethlehem residents and from an outside perspective agree with much of their reasoning not only would there be large environmental impacts traffic implications and lack of access to nearby services but also lack of diversity urge everyone involved to deeply reconsider the implications and unanswered questions of the housing plan first presbyterian hopes to create an inclusive community but there is no consideration of diverse perspectives and inclusion of people from other religions who need affordable housing the church itself would be located at the center of the project dominating its overall environment it seems as though the church by following through with this proposal would only attract people like themselves rather than diverse community laurel marx bethlehem the writer is sophomore at lehigh university read with interest recent your view piece written by congresswoman susan wild am left wondering about the true intent of the article while am glad that there is finally acknowledgement of it time to fix the southern border there was complete lack of perspective on the true cause of this failure the primary failure is not congressional but rather the current administration intentional reversal of successful strategies from the prior administration the almost 10 million illegal border crossings since our current president took office is beyond comprehension his reversal of prior executive orders and failure to consider safe deterrent have led to this liberal mayors of large cities see the scope of the crisis on their door mats rather than acknowledge the true cause of the crisis congresswoman wild tries to blame others in congress the looming economic crisis secondary to millions of illegal crossings rests solely with the current white house and not the republicans in congress the article reads mostly as pr piece and an election year stunt to distract the voting populace from the true cause of the worst crisis facing our homeland for decades to come mark knouse south whitehall township our bethlehem mayor and council pay lip service to increasing affordable housing but are they really serious recently when the city granted permits for hundreds of new apartments right on broad street in downtown bethlehem they failed to work with the builders to have even one new affordable apartment included if the city can tell builder how many electric outlets are required on kitchen counters it can certainly encourage including percentage of low rent units when permitting large projects the city is now demolishing the walnut street parking deck and reducing available parking spaces to make room for apartments let see how many of the city own new living units will be affordable jim disario bethlehem president biden latest plan to cancel or reduce student loans for 25 million americans is indicative that our higher education system is bloated and dysfunctional our colleges and universities are too involved in real estate acquisition and development professional sports athlete farming indoctrination of political ideologies money laundering and accumulation of wealth for their individual institutions thus they fail to recruit admit and properly educate highly ethical and professional doctors lawyers teachers and other members of our professional class who are capable of obtaining and sustaining employment in order to pay back their student loans all of this occurs under the umbrella of not for profit status and not for profit laws most of these colleges and universities are sitting on endowments in excess of hundreds of millions of dollars while our federal government sits on debt in excess of 34 trillion and will ask the taxpayers to absorb all of this student loan debt these same student loans helped make these college and university endowments as fat as they are commission needs to be formed to realign our higher education system

palm beach fla jordan vassallo is lukewarm about casting her first presidential ballot for president joe biden in november but when the 18 year old senior at jupiter high school in florida thinks about the things she cares about she says her vote for the democratic incumbent is an obvious choice vassallo will be voting for constitutional ballot amendment that would prevent the state of florida from prohibiting abortion before fetus can survive on its own essentially the standard that existed nationally before the s supreme court struck down the constitutional protections to abortion and left the matter for states to decide passage of the amendment would wipe away florida six week abortion law which took effect wednesday vassallo says the ban makes no sense most people don know they are pregnant at six weeks she said biden despite her reticence will get her vote as well in florida and across the nation voters in vassallo age group could prove pivotal in the 2024 election from the presidency to ballot amendments and down ballot races that will determine who controls congress she is likely to be among more than 8 million new voters eligible to vote this november since the 2022 elections according to tufts university center for information and research on civic learning and engagement jayden onofrio passes out plan condoms and rolling papers to educate young voters april 11 at florida atlantic university in boca raton fla in florida and across the nation young voters drawn by abortion and marijuana measures could prove pivotal in the 2024 election from the presidency to ballot amendments and down ballot races that will determine who controls congress while some of those voters share vassallo priorities of gun violence prevention and abortion rights recent protests on college campuses about the war between israel and hamas including at some florida campuses have thrown new element of uncertainty into the mix in florida and elsewhere observers across the political spectrum are looking on with intense interest florida democrats hope young voters will be driven to the polls by ballot amendments legalizing marijuana and enshrining abortion rights they hope the more tolerant views of young voters on those issues will reverse an active voter registration edge of nearly 900 000 for republicans in florida which has turned from the ultimate swing state in 2000 to reliably republican in recent years according to ap votecast an expansive survey of the electorate about 8 in 10 florida voters under age 45 in the 2022 midterm elections said the supreme court decision overturning roe wade had an impact on their decision to vote and who to support the youngest voters under age 30 appeared more likely than others to say the decision was the single most important factor in their votes with about 3 in 10 saying that compared with about 2 in 10 older voters college students pass out plan to educate young voters at florida atlantic university april 11 2024 in boca raton fla abortion and marijuana will be on florida november ballot and these issues are critical issues for young voters nathan mitchell president of florida atlantic university college republicans questions how impactful abortion will be in the election according to ap votecast relatively few florida voters in the 2022 midterms believed abortion should be either completely banned or fully permitted in all cases even among republicans just 12 said abortion should be illegal in all cases about half of republicans said it should be banned in most cases voters under 45 were slightly more likely than others to say abortion should always be legal with 30 taking that position mitchell said while abortion is strong issue especially for women he doesn think it will drive many younger voters to the polls think other amendments will probably do that especially the recreational marijuana amendment mitchell said think that going to bring out lot more voters than abortion will the ap votecast survey lends some credence to his thinking about 6 in 10 florida voters in the 2022 elections favored legalizing the recreational use of marijuana nationwide the survey found among voters under 45 that was 76 still it unclear how important that issue is for younger voters compared with other issues the big question is whether other issues can override biden enthusiasm problem among young florida voters and elsewhere six in 10 adults under 30 nationally said in december ap norc center for public affairs research poll that they would be dissatisfied with biden as the democratic party nominee in 2024 and only about 2 in 10 said in march poll that excited would describe their emotions if biden were re elected young voters were crucial to the broad and racially diverse coalition that helped elect biden in 2020 about 6 in 10 voters under 30 backed biden nationally according to ap votecast pew research center survey showed that those under age 30 made up 38 of new or irregular voters in that election new issues that concern young voters have emerged this year biden handling of the israel hamas war has sparked protests at college campuses across the country and biden inability to deliver broad based student loan forgiveness affects many young voters directly matheus xavier 21 who studies biology at florida atlantic university said he considered voting for trump at some point but changed his mind since biden fell more in line with the things he cares about including the preservation of abortion rights at the end of the day you gotta go with what you support he said guess biden kinda shows more of that if there was another option that was actually good d probably go for that college students are ready to make their voices heard in the upcoming

palm beach fla jordan vassallo is lukewarm about casting her first presidential ballot for president joe biden in november but when the 18 year old senior at jupiter high school in florida thinks about the things she cares about she says her vote for the democratic incumbent is an obvious choice vassallo will be voting for constitutional ballot amendment that would prevent the state of florida from prohibiting abortion before fetus can survive on its own essentially the standard that existed nationally before the s supreme court struck down the constitutional protections to abortion and left the matter for states to decide passage of the amendment would wipe away florida six week abortion law which took effect wednesday vassallo says the ban makes no sense most people don know they are pregnant at six weeks she said biden despite her reticence will get her vote as well in florida and across the nation voters in vassallo age group could prove pivotal in the 2024 election from the presidency to ballot amendments and down ballot races that will determine who controls congress she is likely to be among more than 8 million new voters eligible to vote this november since the 2022 elections according to tufts university center for information and research on civic learning and engagement jayden onofrio passes out plan condoms and rolling papers to educate young voters april 11 at florida atlantic university in boca raton fla in florida and across the nation young voters drawn by abortion and marijuana measures could prove pivotal in the 2024 election from the presidency to ballot amendments and down ballot races that will determine who controls congress while some of those voters share vassallo priorities of gun violence prevention and abortion rights recent protests on college campuses about the war between israel and hamas including at some florida campuses have thrown new element of uncertainty into the mix in florida and elsewhere observers across the political spectrum are looking on with intense interest florida democrats hope young voters will be driven to the polls by ballot amendments legalizing marijuana and enshrining abortion rights they hope the more tolerant views of young voters on those issues will reverse an active voter registration edge of nearly 900 000 for republicans in florida which has turned from the ultimate swing state in 2000 to reliably republican in recent years according to ap votecast an expansive survey of the electorate about 8 in 10 florida voters under age 45 in the 2022 midterm elections said the supreme court decision overturning roe wade had an impact on their decision to vote and who to support the youngest voters under age 30 appeared more likely than others to say the decision was the single most important factor in their votes with about 3 in 10 saying that compared with about 2 in 10 older voters college students pass out plan to educate young voters at florida atlantic university april 11 2024 in boca raton fla abortion and marijuana will be on florida november ballot and these issues are critical issues for young voters nathan mitchell president of florida atlantic university college republicans questions how impactful abortion will be in the election according to ap votecast relatively few florida voters in the 2022 midterms believed abortion should be either completely banned or fully permitted in all cases even among republicans just 12 said abortion should be illegal in all cases about half of republicans said it should be banned in most cases voters under 45 were slightly more likely than others to say abortion should always be legal with 30 taking that position mitchell said while abortion is strong issue especially for women he doesn think it will drive many younger voters to the polls think other amendments will probably do that especially the recreational marijuana amendment mitchell said think that going to bring out lot more voters than abortion will the ap votecast survey lends some credence to his thinking about 6 in 10 florida voters in the 2022 elections favored legalizing the recreational use of marijuana nationwide the survey found among voters under 45 that was 76 still it unclear how important that issue is for younger voters compared with other issues the big question is whether other issues can override biden enthusiasm problem among young florida voters and elsewhere six in 10 adults under 30 nationally said in december ap norc center for public affairs research poll that they would be dissatisfied with biden as the democratic party nominee in 2024 and only about 2 in 10 said in march poll that excited would describe their emotions if biden were re elected young voters were crucial to the broad and racially diverse coalition that helped elect biden in 2020 about 6 in 10 voters under 30 backed biden nationally according to ap votecast pew research center survey showed that those under age 30 made up 38 of new or irregular voters in that election new issues that concern young voters have emerged this year biden handling of the israel hamas war has sparked protests at college campuses across the country and biden inability to deliver broad based student loan forgiveness affects many young voters directly matheus xavier 21 who studies biology at florida atlantic university said he considered voting for trump at some point but changed his mind since biden fell more in line with the things he cares about including the preservation of abortion rights at the end of the day you gotta go with what you support he said guess biden kinda shows more of that if there was another option that was actually good d probably go for that college students are ready to make their voices heard in the upcoming

mcbath ga and lauren underwood ill both of whom are black as great diversity candidates and last week trone ignited barrage of criticism after he referred to some alsobrooks supporters as low level

funding he been successful at the american dream that what we all want said sarah holley 76 year old who voted for hogan once previously but plans to vote for trone in the primary and general election

raspy voice and gruff demeanor ensured the baltimore audience they can feel good about his spending because he not an overnight success having gradually expanding his family wine and beer store into 30 state chain after his family chicken farm went under m slow slow success and because ve been successful can use my finances to pay for this election he said advertisement trone says he doesn need the buck 175 or 174 000 annual salary that comes with being congressman and stresses he focused as lawmaker on mental health and substance use disorder treatment and prison reform don care about the bullshit that goes with being in congress and running campaigns trone told huffpost thumping his hand against table for emphasis actually hate it alsobrooks young looking gen xer who can quietly command room didn mention trone by name to the group of volunteers clad in neon green campaign tees at her rally last friday but his presence hung over the event you know there are some in this race who talk and it makes me so angry the more heard about the pandering the talk about second chances said alsobrooks swiping at trone push to employ formerly incarcerated people at his liquor stores see all of us as people first alsobrooks told huffpost that trone money advantage means she had to work 10 times as hard as him but m accustomed to that she described her upbringing as the daughter of receptionist and newspaper distributor in the same county where she now the top elected official ve never had it easy before she said advertisement the washington post in its endorsement of alsobrooks over trone for the nomination lauded her stewardship of prince george during the pandemic and through public safety emergencies and her push for the fbi new headquarters to be built in greenbelt maryland those aspects of her record are also things she points to on the stump is trone racist or something close to it for his recent remarks and how he running this race alsobrooks wouldn go there think his language is reflective of his mindset mean you heard him refer to very talented congresswomen as diversity candidates it a reflection of how he feels about women candidates generally and think more specifically some of the other language that he used speaks for itself she said belinda lindsay 61 year old college professor who showed up to see alsobrooks last week said alsobrooks is

trial",https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/hush-money-catch-kill-guide-unique-terms-trumps-109937547,abcnews,https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/wirestory_8b59e858a81feea5700e7bfcc77f1c09_4x3_384.jpg,new york ap donald trump new york criminal trial is full of terms you don typically hear in courtroom centering on allegations trump falsified his company records to conceal the nature of hush money reimbursements it the first ever criminal trial of former s president and the first of trump four indictments to go to trial it also has some unique terminology here are some examples definition according to merriam webster it money paid so that someone will keep information secret in other words money that person pays someone to hush up something example three payments that prosecutors say were made on trump behalf to bury marital infidelity claims during his 2016 presidential campaign they are the national enquirer 30 000 payment to trump tower doorman and 150 000 payment to former playboy model karen mcdougal and the 130 000 that trump then lawyer and fixer michael cohen arranged to pay porn actor stormy daniels paying hush money isn illegal on its own but authorities say the payments made to suppress stories about trump amounted to illegal campaign contributions cohen pleaded guilty in 2018 to federal campaign violation among other unrelated crimes the national enquirer parent company american media inc entered into nonprosecution agreement in exchange for its cooperation with prosecutors the federal election commission fined the company 187 500 declaring that the mcdougal deal was prohibited corporate in kind contribution definition as prosecutor matthew colangelo told jurors in his opening statement catch and kill is when tabloid newspaper such as the national enquirer buys up damaging information about someone demands that the source sign nondisclosure agreement to prevent them from taking that information or that story anywhere else and then the tabloid declines to publish the story to prevent it from ever seeing the light of day nondisclosure agreement is also known as confidentiality agreement example tabloids typically pay sources and story subjects for information they end up publishing but sometimes they pay for stories to prevent their publication former national enquirer publisher david pecker testified that he agreed at trump tower meeting in august 2015 to be the eyes and ears of trump 2016 presidential campaign under the arrangement pecker said he would notify cohen of women who were seeking to sell stories about trump so trump team could take them off the market or kill them in some manner pecker testified that he had suppressed stories about other celebrities and politicians over the years using the same catch and kill methods including actor and ex california gov arnold schwarzenegger and golfer tiger woods pecker said he sometimes suppressed stories simply to help friend or further his business interests but often he did so to leverage the story subject into doing something else like agreeing to an interview or posing for magazine cover definition this is the criminal charge that being decided at trump new york trial he is charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree it is felony punishable by up to four years in prison though there is no guarantee trump would be sentenced to any time if convicted he has pleaded not guilty under new york law person is guilty of falsifying business records in the first degree when he makes or causes false entry to be made in company business records and does so with an intent to defraud including intent to commit or hide another crime example prosecutors allege trump misrepresented payments to cohen in trump company records as legal fees when they were actually reimbursement for the 130 000 that cohen arranged to pay daniels the records at issue include general ledger entries invoices and checks prosecutors argue trump actions were way of hiding the hush money scheme and concealing other crimes arising from it including alleged law violations trump denies the allegations his lawyers have said the payments to cohen were for legitimate legal expenses definition trump isn charged with the crime of conspiracy but prosecutors at his new york trial have used the term repeatedly to describe his eyes and ears agreement with pecker and the hush money arrangements that ensued according to merriam webster conspiring involves joining in secret agreement to do an unlawful or wrongful act or an act which becomes unlawful as result of the secret agreement under new york law conspiracy involves at least two people acting with intent to commit crime example colangelo the prosecutor said in his opening statement that trump trial involves an illegal conspiracy to undermine the integrity of presidential election to convict trump of felony falsifying business records prosecutors must show that he had intent to commit another crime assistant district attorney joshua steinglass said in court that one of the crimes trump intended to commit was violation of new york election law misdemeanor involving conspiracy to promote or prevent an election definition any attempt to alter the outcome of an election through nefarious means such as fraud voter intimidation or efforts to overturn the outcome of race example prosecutors allege the hush money scheme amounted to election interference because it involved concerted effort to hide important information from voters in order to boost trump chances in the 2016 race not only was the national enquirer acting as the eyes and ears of trump campaign identifying negative stories so they could be suppressed pecker testified that the tabloid at cohen behest printed stories that tarred trump opponents it also published stories that boosted trump image it a different kind of election interference allegation from what trump is charged with in his washington and georgia cases where he accused of attempting to subvert his 2020 election loss to democrat joe biden meanwhile trump claims that being put on trial while he campaigning as this year presumptive republican nominee is its own form of election interference definition generally speaking gag order is judicial ruling barring public disclosure or discussion as by the press of information related to case according to merriam webster in trump case it known as an order restricting extrajudicial statements with extrajudicial meaning outside of court example judge juan merchan acting on request from prosecutors imposed limited gag order on trump on march 26 it bars the former president from making or directing other people to make public statements on his behalf about potential witnesses regarding their participation in the case it also prohibits comments about jurors prosecutors other than district attorney alvin bragg and any statements meant to interfere with or harass the court staff prosecution team or their families merchan expanded the order on april 1 barring trump from commenting about his family or bragg family the change came after trump assailed the judge daughter and made false claims about her on social media last tuesday trump was assessed 9 000 fine 1 000 for each of nine separate gag order violations that the judge identified prosecutors later requested an additional 4 000 penalty for what they said were additional breaches of the order merchan lamented that 1 000 per violation is the maximum fine allowed by law and floated the possibility of jailing trump if he continues to run afoul of the gag order an unprecedented outcome for former american president trump lawyers insist he needs leeway to respond to criticism including from witnesses like cohen and daniels and that the gag order impedes his ability to answer questions and defend himself amid crush of media coverage of his case and his candidacy ___ follow sisak at com mikesisak and

the woman brother stepped into the two bedroom apartment in south carolina capital smiling tentatively at what would come next inside church volunteers had made quilts for the beds and set out an orange and yellow plastic dump truck and other toys for the couple son the family watched closely as translator showed them key features in their apartment which knob matched which burner on the stovetop how the garbage disposal and window blinds worked they practiced working the thermostat and checked the water in the shower we are so happy to get this place kaaskile kashindi said through translator now 28 kashindi was born in congo and fled with his family at age 3 to refugee camp in tanzania where he lived until this spring that when he his wife little boy and brother in law moved to columbia university town of 140 000 people we re still new we just need help right now kashindi said scenes like this are becoming more common as the american refugee program long haven for people fleeing violence around the world rebounds from years of cutbacks under donald trump administration the biden administration has worked to streamline the process of screening and placing people in america while refugee resettlement agencies have opened new sites across the country if president meets his target of 125 000 admitted this year it would be the highest number of arrivals in more than three decades trump the presumptive republican nominee in 2020 rematch with biden this fall has pledged to bar refugees from gaza and reinstate his muslim ban if elected while also putting in place ideological screening for all immigrants trump website highlights his first term decision to temporarily suspend the refugee program even with legal or not divisive campaign issue many who help refugees settle in the united states say the growing numbers of refugees have been generally welcomed by communities and employers in need of workers the word refugee is sometimes broadly used to refer to anyone fleeing war or persecution often it conflated with asylum seekers who come directly to the s mexico border people like the family from congo are coming through different process starting with an application abroad and with thorough vetting that can take years usually they are referred to s officials by the n refugee agency then interviewed by american immigration officials there are background checks and medical screening the lucky few who are approved fly to towns across america to start new lives with the help of nationwide network of resettlement agencies they are eligible to become citizens eventually for decades america led the world in refugee admissions in program that had wide bipartisan support trump cut the program to the quick by the time he left office in january 2021 he had set record low goal of 15 000 refugees admitted year but even that mark wasn hit only 11 814 refugees came to the s in trump last year compared with 84 994 at the end of the obama administration biden said he would reestablish the s as haven for refugees it took while his administration is now admitting more refugees and added about 150 new resettlement sites nationwide said sarah cross deputy assistant secretary for the state department bureau of population refugees and migration to reach goal of 125 000 refugees admitted this year the highest number since 1992 the department has been increasing its overseas processing and making changes that streamline all the checks refugees undergo while keeping screening rigorous cross said it has hired more staff and is doing more trips to interview prospective refugees overseas in 2020 lutheran services carolinas resettled about 40 refugees in columbia this year the organization expects to welcome about 440 said seth hershberger the nonprofit refugee resettlement and immigration director it has opened new sites in charleston greenville and myrtle beach it is chaotic sometimes hershberger said from the agency office tucked into lutheran church but with the support we ve had it been good good journey the office is bustle of case managers employment specialists and other staffers some were once refugees themselves these staff and volunteers usually meet arriving refugees making sure meal they recognize is waiting for them from there it a whirlwind of medical appointments registration at government offices opening bank account enrolling kids in school and eventually moving into permanent housing such as the kashindi family apartment they take classes in what is called survival english how to call 911 if someone is sick for example or remembering your address so you can tell someone if you get lost in one recent class five refugees sat at desks at local church down the hall volunteer watched their kids so they could work on learning new language the lesson was focused on calendars and days of the week interspersed with bit of american culture in america the calendar is very important there a lot of dates you ll need to know said teacher sarah lewis such as their children birthdays doctor appointments and much more two students were sisters from honduras who had fled their homes and traveled to mexico where they lived for about year until they learned they had been approved to come to south carolina leliz bonilla castro said she didn know much about columbia when she arrived but she liked the warm weather and welcoming people she said the refugee program had given her and her three children future for those who want and have the opportunity to come to this country it is the best way to save your life and to have better future for your kids which are the ones we think about the most as parents she said through translator it wasn too long ago that south carolina was one of many republican leaning states that balked at efforts to bring in syrian refugees hershberger the lutheran services resettlement chief pointed to another event the s evacuation of tens of thousands of afghans from kabul during the 2021 troop withdrawal as game changer it led to an outpouring from americans wanting to help when they saw people grabbing onto the planes and fleeing for their lives think that really struck chord with lot of people he said the nonprofit also hears from employers eager for workers hershberger said one of them is jordan loewen whose columbia based company cleans facilities or fleets like big garbage trucks it dirty hard work he said during the pandemic when it was tough to find workers someone suggested he hire refugees loewen gave it shot and now refugees account for nearly half his staff he also recommends the resettlement program to other employers in addition to getting workers he said it amazing hearing what these guys have come out of and the struggles that they ve gone through in their life to get to this point of being in america global refuge one of 10 national resettlement agencies that work with local networks like the one in columbia is preparing for what trump presidency might mean for its work it a huge cloud we feel like we may be running up against cliff here said megan bracy the organization resettlement

during closed door meetings and private phone calls trump sources recount has pointedly asked questions regarding her decision to kill the dog including specifically why would she do that and what is wrong with her suebsaeng wrote he has expressed bewilderment that she would have ever admitted to doing this willingly and in her own writing and has argued it demonstrates she has poor grasp of

nuanced and critical thinking just as over reliance on crutches can cause leg muscles to atrophy over exposure to electronics and addictive but thoughtless social media can atrophy the learning centers of the brain smartphones aren the only culprit recent studies have also shown that high levels of noise including exposure to high decibel music at home or in the car and loud omnipresent

has been presented stands out as breathtaking according to former prosecutor saturday ex federal prosecutor glenn kirschner went on the legal breakdown where he talked about trump trial and secret recording played in court the recording made undercover by trump former attorney and fixer michael cohen had trump and cohen discussing so called catch and kill scheme to keep an affair quiet but the host brian tyler cohen also asked kirschner about how stormy daniels lawyer keith davidson admitted that the scheme likely impacted the presidential election in 2016 also read trump manhattan trial could determine whether rule of law survives criminologist that was bit of testimony that was pretty breathtaking kirschner said and it actually undercuts one of the defense assertions that they re trying to use to wiggle out of trump criminal responsibility for this he continued what keith davidson testified to is that he was engaged in this hush money payment and covering these things up and then when it looked like donald trump is going to win the election keith davidson said oh my god what did we do and the import of that is twofold one they recognized the potentially dramatic damage they had done to the country by engaging in conduct that may have actually facilitated donald trump getting elected the second important piece according to the former prosecutor is that it clear that keith davidson and the others involved in this scheme knew that these hush money payments were being made to impact the election not to try to conceal information from melania or donald trump family

19,575188146094ac1e7cf9c986e7c077c3,What a judge's gag order on Trump means in his hush money case,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/judges-gag-order-trump-means-hush-money-case-109937363,abcnews,https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/wirestory_fae616037d3606cc60abbffb0e91f7ee_4x3_384.jpg,virtually every day of his hush money criminal trial former president talks about how he can talk about the case gag order bars trump from commenting publicly on witnesses jurors and some others connected to the matter the new york judge already has found that trump the presumptive republican nominee for president repeatedly violated the order fined him 9 000 and warning that jail could follow if he doesn comply but the order doesn stop trump from talking about the allegations against him or commenting on the judge or the elected top prosecutor and despite recent trump remark it doesn stop him from testifying in court if he chooses as he fights the felony charges against him while running for president trump has at times stirred confusion about what he can and can do in the case he has pleaded not guilty so what does the order do what doesn it and where did it come from generally speaking gag order is judge directive prohibiting someone or people involved in court case from publicly commenting about some or all aspects of it in trump case it titled an order restricting extrajudicial statements with extrajudicial meaning outside of court gag orders particularly in high profile cases are intended to prevent information presented outside courtroom from affecting what happens inside trump also is subject to gag order in his federal criminal election interference case in washington that order limits what he can say about witnesses lawyers in the case and court staff though an appeals court freed him to speak about special counsel jack smith who brought the case in his recent new york civil fraud trial trump was fined total of 15 000 for comments he made about that judge law clerk after gag order barred participants in the trial from posting emailing or speaking publicly about the court staff the s supreme court has acknowledged that gag orders can pit fair trial rights against free speech rights the court has struck down some orders that barred the press from reporting on certain cases or court proceedings and rejected as too vague nevada court rule that limited what all lawyers could say out of court yes before the trial he asked state appeals court to postpone the trial while he appeals the gag order but the court refused his appeal of the order itself is ongoing initially imposed march 26 the gag order bars trump from making or directing others to make public statements about any juror and about any reasonably foreseeable witness participation in the investigation or the trial it also bars any statements about lawyers in the case court staffers prosecution aides and relatives of all of the above to the extent that the statements are intended to materially interfere with or to cause others to materially interfere with their work on the case or with the knowledge that such interference is likely to result the order doesn apply to judge juan merchan or to manhattan district attorney alvin bragg whose office is bringing the case it does apply to comments about their family members however merchan added that provision on april 1 after trump lashed out on social media at the judge daughter democratic political consultant and made claim about her that was later repudiated by court officials trump is also allowed to talk about his political opponents as merchan made clear on thursday the order also doesn bar witnesses from commenting on trump michael cohen trump ex lawyer and an expected witness has routinely attacked his former boss leading trump to complain about not being able to respond in kind yes the s supreme court has held that criminal defendants have constitutional right to take the stand in their own defense or not to there was some confusion after trump said thursday that because of the gag order he was not allowed to testify in context it appeared he was actually referring to his ability to respond to reporter court hallway question about witness testimony that afternoon trump clarified to reporters friday that he understood the order wasn a bar on testifying merchan emphasized the same in court want to stress mr trump you have an absolute right to testify at trial if that what you decide to do after consultation with your attorneys merchan said merchan found that trump violated the gag order with social media posts that laid into cohen among the offending posts one that asked whether disgraced attorney and felon michael cohen been prosecuted for lying repost of new york post article that described cohen as serial perjurer and trump post referring to fox news host jesse watters claim that liberal activists were lying to infiltrate the jury merchan noted that trump comment on the watters segment misstated what the host had actually said making the comment the words of defendant himself on the other hand merchan declined to sanction trump for an april 10 post that referred to cohen and stormy daniels the porn performer who got 130 000 hush money payment that at the heart of the case as sleaze bags trump contended that he was responding to previous comments by cohen and the judge said the back and forth gave him pause as to whether that post met the bar for violation when merchan fined trump 1 000 apiece for nine violations the maximum fine allowed by law he wrote that jail may be necessary punishment for some wealthy defendants who won be deterred by such sum merchan added that he will not tolerate continued willful violations of the gag order and that if necessary and appropriate he will impose an incarceratory punishment meaning jail it unclear what would rise to the level of necessary and appropriate defense lawyer todd blanche indicated in court friday that he plans to appeal the judge finding this past week that trump violated the gag order prosecutors have asked merchan to hold trump in contempt again and fine him 1 000 for each of four alleged violations from april 22 25 but the prosecution isn asking for the former president to be locked up over those comments because they happened before merchan jail warning and because we prefer to minimize disruption to this proceeding prosecutor christopher conroy said ,['anonymous'],99

impacted her faith new you can now listen to fox news articles if you come to colorado in the summer and spend weekend with my family we ll likely force you to go over one of the nearby mountain passes with us in some kind of four wheel drive vehicle the narrow roads are unpaved bumpy and sometimes little too close to the edge of cliffs and steep drop offs on the side of the mountain these mountain adventures have become one of my favorite pastimes though they weren always in fact two decades ago when we first lived in this part of colorado day spent in vehicle getting jostled around on windy mountain trails seemed like total waste of time my husband troy loved it but couldn understand the appeal he called it an adventure he felt challenged and alive in the mountains he was motivated to see and witness untouched parts of creation had completely different narrative about off roading off roading is not productive unless you consider getting from point to point in six hours at snail pace productive on top of that it uncomfortable and dangerous mean you could get flat tire whiplash or fall off cliff plus there are no bathrooms along the way no convenience stores for bag of chips or topo chico and no restaurants at the top of the mountain and once you get to the top of where you re going the air is thin and cold ll have headache for the rest of the day hallmark actress reveals how unlikely role taught her about god love eventually changed up lots of logistics that led to more enjoyment cooler full of drinks and snacks fun playlist bringing along ibuprofen and drinking lots of water but the biggest change made was the narrative rehearsed what chose to think about ultimately changed my mind about off roading what was telling myself about my present circumstances was more powerful than d realized author ruth chou simons with her family the same is true about the not yet wonderful circumstances in our lives what narratives are you rehearsing about where you are right

as the american refugee program long haven for people fleeing violence around the world rebounds from years of cutbacks under donald trump administration the biden administration has worked to streamline the process of screening and placing people in america while refugee resettlement agencies have opened new sites across the country if president joe biden meets his target of 125 000

the refugee program even with immigration legal or not divisive campaign issue many who help refugees settle in the united states say the growing numbers of refugees have been generally welcomed by communities and employers in need of workers the word refugee is sometimes broadly used to refer to anyone fleeing war or persecution often it conflated with asylum seekers who come directly to the s

bengtson was riding her bicycle near charles city on sunny sunday evening in 2020 when she was killed by driver who was opening an app on his cellphone the driver admitted on video at the scene that he been looking at social media on his phone and had not seen her before his ford 150 drifted and struck her from behind while going over 55 mph an iowa state patrol crash report stated the driver sent text messages telling others he was on his cellphone when the collision occurred the report said and that he never saw the 28 year old chemical engineer riding on the shoulder investigators said cellphone data and records back that up the driver was charged with reckless homicide by vehicle punishable with up to 10 years in prison the case seemed open and shut but because iowa lacks hands free while driving law the judge dismissed the case the driver walked free the judge and defense attorney focused on whether the driver was manually manipulating his phone at the time of the crash the judge found there was insufficient evidence to sustain conviction under the state prohibition on texting while driving enacted in 2017 under current law drivers may still use their phones on the road

in 2020 when she was killed by driver who was opening an app on his cellphone for the last two years ellen parents peter and joann bengtson have pushed iowa lawmakers alongside law enforcement and traffic safety advocates to do as 34 other states have done prohibit drivers from using handheld cellphones while driving the iowa senate last year overwhelmingly passed bill senate file 547 that would ban motorists handheld use of cellphones behind the wheel but the iowa house hit the brakes it failed to advance during this year legislative session which ended last month after the proposal was combined with legislation that would ban traffic enforcement cameras bills limiting cellphone use by mandating voice activated or hands free technology while driving have been introduced in the iowa legislature since 2019 but all attempts at passage have been unsuccessful this is not political issue this is safety issue peter bengtson said lawmakers are supposed to be out there advocating for our well being to blow this off for several years now it seems unconscionable to me it was sickening more people died on iowa roads last year than in each of the past five years total of 378 people died in car crashes in iowa in 2023 12 increase from 2022 excessive speed distracted driving impaired driving and not wearing seat belts are some of the motorist behaviors pushing fatalities up from 2014 to 2023 78 people were killed in the state by distracted drivers using cellphone or other handheld electronic device according to the iowa department of transportation another 5 016 were injured during that period casualties caused by distracted drivers using cellphone over the last 10 years averaged about 3 for all traffic deaths and 4 for all traffic injuries in iowa the iowa dot however notes distracted driving is underreported and the numbers do not reflect how widespread the issue actually is across the country distracted driving caused 12 405 fatalities in 2021 or 28 of all traffic deaths that year at societal cost of approximately 158 billion according to estimates from the national highway traffic safety administration in 2022 3 308 people were killed in crashes

damaged ford 150 that drifted and struck her from behind at 55 plus miles per hour the bengtsons state law enforcement officials and the iowa bicycle coalition plan to launch campaign to press lawmakers to finally pass legislation next year banning the use of handheld electronic device while driving we re going to double down and keep the public pressure on because iowans want this said luke hoffman executive director of the iowa bicycle coalition the iowa state patrol and the governor traffic safety bureau conducted survey during the 2023 iowa state fair and found that an overwhelming majority of those surveyed supported hands free device driving legislation they spoke to about 1 500 people 85 of whom supported the legislation and 51 admitted to always or sometimes having mobile device in hand while driving similarly statewide polling by the des moines register mediacom iowa poll shows more than two thirds of iowans want legislators to ban motorists from holding cellphones or other electronic devices while they re driving hoffman and the bengtsons also point to data that shows distracted driving has fallen in other states that have passed the law 2024 report by the governors highway safety association nonprofit representing state highway safety offices describes how after alabama michigan missouri and ohio implemented hands free laws incidents of reported distracted driving fell for example since ohio enacted hands free law in april 2023 researchers estimated that 3 060 crashes 1 700 injuries and 14 fatalities have been prevented economic damages across 8 million drivers had been reduced by more than 121 million the report recommended that states adopt strong and clear hands free laws as part of broader approach to improve road safety that includes education enforcement and the use of safe driving technology researchers note similar initiatives have succeeded in reducing drunken driving deaths and increasing seat belt usage sgt alex dinkla public information officer with the iowa state patrol said troopers have seen an increase in crashes and lane departures related to distracted driving law enforcement officials have asked lawmakers in recent years to pass legislation to ban handheld use of mobile devices while driving the state existing prohibition on texting while driving is difficult to enforce dinkla said because the exceptions in the law still allow drivers to have phone in their hand while at the wheel there are loopholes in the law we want to clear up and make it clear and convincing to everyone that what you re supposed to be doing is driving the vehicle and not on your cellphone or electronic communication device dinkla said we don want to continue delaying this and continue to have fatalities to use those statistics to continue to educate why we need this law he said we want to make sure we are taking proactive approach to make iowa road safe every single motorist is affected by people texting and driving because we all share the same roadways rep brian best republican from glidden who chairs the house transportation committee said he is disappointed over the lack of support within the house gop caucus for bill to ban handheld phone use while driving the senate bill provided exceptions for the use of an electronic device in voice activated or hands free mode and for first responders while on duty and health care professionals in the course of emergency situations it also provides exceptions for receiving weather or emergency alert reporting an emergency situation for those operating farm machinery and for certain radio operators and transit drivers despite bipartisan and law enforcement support libertarian wing of republicans in the gop controlled house objected to the legislation saying it infringes on iowans individual rights rep john wills republican from spirit lake said lawmakers instead should look at other ways to more broadly crack down on activity that diverts attention from driving not just talking or texting on phone in my perspective as long as you re not injuring anyone else which distracted driving can lead to the government shouldn have any business doing anything wills said he added distracted driving is the culprit it not the phone let not make the phone the enemy wills said the phone is not the enemy it the person holding the phone or the mcdonald cheeseburger or doing their makeup let cure the disease rather than putting band aid on it and make distracted driving laws tougher and more enforceable iowa house speaker pro temper john wills speaks during the opening day of the iowa legislature monday jan 9 2023 in des moines iowa ap photo charlie neibergall asked what such measure would look like wills suggested legislation allowing police to pull over and cite for distracted driving motorists who cross centerline let not punish everyone for the actions of few he said wills said he also opposes requiring use of seat belt law in iowa dating to july 1986 even though it proven to save people lives that an individual own decision it the same principle too he said the iowa bicycle coalition hoffman said wills framing of the issue presents false choice of freedom versus saving lives what is the first responsibility of government it is to protect the people hoffman said if we want to be more free and have the fullest lives as iowans and be the best state we have to pass this it not about horse trading life for liberty wills foresees the legislation coming back before lawmakers next year don know where it will go

it something we ll never get over photo credit burdun iliya shutterstock teen drivers are one of the highest risk groups on the road young drivers are more likely to make mistakes from inexperience get distracted by devices or other passengers or engage in risky behaviors like speeding not wearing seatbelt or drinking and driving in recent decades more states have implemented policy change in an effort to reduce risks for teen drivers and those who share the road with them most notably states have adopted that progressively scale up young drivers privileges on the road as they get more experience behind the wheel states have also introduced stronger laws on the use of seatbelts mobile devices and substances which apply to all motorists but are particular risk factors for teens recent years have shown marked decline in teen vehicle fatalities as result of these reforms in 2005 total of 4 874 teens were killed in vehicle crash by 2019 that figure had fallen by more than half to 2 165 however there remains significant gap between male and female fatalities in 2019 the number of male fatalities 1 450 was over twice as high as the number of female fatalities 715 for teens aged 15 to 19 one of the factors contributing to this difference is male drivers tendency to engage in more risky behaviors behind the wheel compared to their female counterparts for example there is statistically significant difference between the genders on seatbelt use with 7 4 of males not wearing seatbelt compared to 5 6 of females male teen drivers also have slight statistically insignificant edge in cell phone use 39 6 for males and 38 4 for females though it is most concerning that the rate of phone use while driving for both genders is so high distracted driving including using phone while behind the wheel is highly risky responsible for more than annually and more than some research estimates that texting while driving is even more likely to lead to crash than driving under the influence this is particular issue for teens who have high rates of phone use the distracted driving problem is worse in some states than others most of the states where teen drivers report the highest phone use are rural states in the midwest or mountain west including five states where more than half of teen drivers admit to using their phones while driving teens in these states also tend to wear seatbelts at lower rate than teen drivers elsewhere the lower volume of cars on rural roads may be contributing to false sense of safety but vehicle accidents in are often more likely to

bengtson was riding her bicycle near charles city on sunny sunday evening in 2020 when she was killed by driver who was opening an app on his cellphone the driver admitted on video at the scene that he been looking at social media on his phone and had not seen her before his ford 150 drifted and struck her from behind while going over 55 mph an iowa state patrol crash report stated the driver sent text messages telling others he was on his cellphone when the collision occurred the report said and that he never saw the 28 year old chemical engineer riding on the shoulder investigators said cellphone data and records back that up the driver was charged with reckless homicide by vehicle punishable with up to 10 years in prison the case seemed open and shut but because iowa lacks hands free while driving law the judge dismissed the case the driver walked free the judge and defense attorney focused on whether the driver was manually manipulating his phone at the time of the crash the judge found there was insufficient evidence to sustain conviction under the state prohibition on texting while driving enacted in 2017 under current law drivers may still use their phones on the road

in 2020 when she was killed by driver who was opening an app on his cellphone for the last two years ellen parents peter and joann bengtson have pushed iowa lawmakers alongside law enforcement and traffic safety advocates to do as 34 other states have done prohibit drivers from using handheld cellphones while driving the iowa senate last year overwhelmingly passed bill senate file 547 that would ban motorists handheld use of cellphones behind the wheel but the iowa house hit the brakes it failed to advance during this year legislative session which ended last month after the proposal was combined with legislation that would ban traffic enforcement cameras bills limiting cellphone use by mandating voice activated or hands free technology while driving have been introduced in the iowa legislature since 2019 but all attempts at passage have been unsuccessful this is not political issue this is safety issue peter bengtson said lawmakers are supposed to be out there advocating for our well being to blow this off for several years now it seems unconscionable to me it was sickening more people died on iowa roads last year than in each of the past five years total of 378 people died in car crashes in iowa in 2023 12 increase from 2022 excessive speed distracted driving impaired driving and not wearing seat belts are some of the motorist behaviors pushing fatalities up from 2014 to 2023 78 people were killed in the state by distracted drivers using cellphone or other handheld electronic device according to the iowa department of transportation another 5 016 were injured during that period casualties caused by distracted drivers using cellphone over the last 10 years averaged about 3 for all traffic deaths and 4 for all traffic injuries in iowa the iowa dot however notes distracted driving is underreported and the numbers do not reflect how widespread the issue actually is across the country distracted driving caused 12 405 fatalities in 2021 or 28 of all traffic deaths that year at societal cost of approximately 158 billion according to estimates from the national highway traffic safety administration in 2022 3 308 people were killed in crashes involving distracted drivers according to the administration lot of people pay through their insurance premiums unfortunately our daughter paid with her life said joann bengtson photo exhibit submitted by prosecutors shows ellen bengtson mangled bicycle she was riding near charles city in 2020 after being hit and killed by driver who was opening an app on his cellphone also pictured is the damaged ford 150 that drifted and struck her from behind at 55 plus miles per hour the bengtsons state law enforcement officials and the iowa bicycle coalition plan to launch campaign to press lawmakers to finally pass legislation next year banning the use of handheld electronic device while driving we re going to double down and keep the public pressure on because iowans want this said luke hoffman executive director of the iowa bicycle coalition the iowa state patrol and the governor traffic safety bureau conducted survey during the 2023 iowa state fair and found that an overwhelming majority of those surveyed supported hands free device driving legislation they spoke to about 1 500 people 85 of whom supported the legislation and 51 admitted to always or sometimes having mobile device in hand while driving similarly statewide polling by the des moines register mediacom iowa poll shows more than two thirds of iowans want legislators to ban motorists from holding cellphones or other electronic devices while they re driving hoffman and the bengtsons also point to data that shows distracted driving has fallen in other states that have passed the law 2024 report by the governors highway safety association nonprofit representing state highway safety offices describes how after alabama michigan missouri and ohio implemented hands free laws incidents of reported distracted driving fell for example since ohio enacted hands free law in april 2023 researchers estimated that 3 060 crashes 1 700 injuries and 14 fatalities have been prevented economic damages across 8 million drivers had been reduced by more than 121 million the report recommended that states adopt strong and clear hands free laws as part of broader approach to improve road safety that includes education enforcement and the use of safe driving technology researchers note similar initiatives have succeeded in reducing drunken driving deaths and increasing seat belt usage sgt alex dinkla public information officer with the iowa state patrol said troopers have seen an increase in crashes and lane departures related to distracted driving law enforcement officials have asked lawmakers in recent years to pass legislation to ban handheld use of mobile devices while driving the state existing prohibition on texting while driving is difficult to enforce dinkla said because the exceptions in the law still allow drivers to have phone in their hand while at the wheel there are loopholes in the law we want to clear up and make it clear and convincing to everyone that what you re supposed to be doing is driving the vehicle and not on your cellphone or electronic communication device dinkla said we don want to continue delaying this and continue to have fatalities to use those statistics to continue to educate why we need this law he said we want to make sure we are taking proactive approach to make iowa road safe every single motorist is affected by people texting and driving because we all share the same roadways rep brian best republican from glidden who chairs the house transportation committee said he is disappointed over the lack of support within the house gop caucus for bill to ban handheld phone use while driving the senate bill provided exceptions for the use of an electronic device in voice activated or hands free mode and for first responders while on duty and health care professionals in the course of emergency situations it also provides exceptions for receiving weather or emergency alert reporting an emergency situation for those operating farm machinery and for certain radio operators and transit drivers despite bipartisan and law enforcement support libertarian wing of republicans in the gop controlled house objected to the legislation saying it infringes on iowans individual rights rep john wills republican from spirit lake said lawmakers instead should look at other ways to more broadly crack down on activity that diverts attention from driving not just talking or texting on phone in my perspective as long as you re not injuring anyone else which distracted driving can lead to the government shouldn have any business doing anything wills said he added distracted driving is the culprit it not the phone let not make the phone the enemy wills said the phone is not the enemy it the person holding the phone or the mcdonald cheeseburger or doing their makeup let cure the disease rather than putting band aid on it and make distracted driving laws tougher and more enforceable iowa house speaker pro temper john wills speaks during the opening day of the iowa legislature monday jan 9 2023 in des moines iowa ap photo charlie neibergall asked what such measure would look like wills suggested legislation allowing police to pull over and cite for distracted driving motorists who cross centerline let not punish everyone for the actions of few he said wills said he also opposes requiring use of seat belt law in iowa dating to july 1986 even though it proven to save people lives that an individual own decision it the same principle too he said the iowa bicycle coalition hoffman said wills framing of the issue presents false choice of freedom versus saving lives what is the first responsibility of government it is to protect the people hoffman said if we want to be more free and have the fullest lives as iowans and be the best state we have to pass this it not about horse trading life for liberty wills foresees the legislation coming back before lawmakers next year don know where it will go

moines speaking to iowa lawmakers at the beginning of this year legislative session gov kim reynolds promised bold vision for the state raising teacher pay overhauling area education agencies cutting taxes and reorganizing large health care and administrative systems reynolds republican proposed more than dozen bills this year dealing with health care education economic growth and the structure of government reynolds was able to usher in many of her proposals largely as written with large republican majorities in the house and senate that are generally supportive of her policy agenda other bills though saw major changes in the lawmaking process and some bills that lawmakers have rejected before failed to pass again the cornerstone of reynolds agenda this year was plan to reorganize the which provide special education support to school districts the bill met significant resistance within her own party as house republicans initially tabled the bill in subcommittee compromise eventually passed with significant changes retaining the aeas as the primary special education providers in the state that law also set the starting salary for teachers at 50 000 by 2026 increasing starting pay for iowa teachers from the bottom half in the nation to among the highest in the 50 states current starting salary for teachers is 33 500 reynolds also proposed major tax bill that would have set flat income tax at 3 5 by next year that bill saw significant changes as well leading republican lawmakers settled on plan that which reynolds signed into law last week gov kim reynolds signs into law legislation that will reduce working iowans state income taxes during ceremony in the governor formal office at the iowa capitol in des moines on wednesday other tax measures in reynolds bill including changes to the unemployment tax employers pay and cutting property taxes for child care centers did not make it into the final law during news conference on wednesday reynolds said she felt good about the results of this year session she said her office was working on nearly 20 bills going into the legislative session joking that it was way too many we took on lot and really feel good about where we landed reynolds said m really proud of the fact that we passed the largest teacher salary increase in the history of the state democrats argued during the session this year that reynolds agenda was politically motivated and did not address the major needs of iowans in areas like housing health care and wages they took specific aim at the aea changes saying they served corporate interests and would weaken special education in iowa house minority leader jennifer konfrst windsor heights noted as the session came to close that republican lawmakers did not come into the session with aea reform as major goal the governor runs this building with republicans her agenda her politics always center stage konfrst said continue to remind my colleagues that we are separate branch of government and that we don work for the governor but the republican leadership and republican legislators sure act like we do iowa house democratic leader jennifer konfrst of windsor heights speaks with reporters saturday april 20 2024 during the last day of the 2024 iowa legislative session konfrst said the session had been defined by republicans making life harder for iowans in areas like voting economic opportunity and special education house speaker pat grassley signaled support for reynolds policy agenda as the session ended but he noted lawmakers reviewed and made changes to some of her proposals the governor laid out very bold agenda when it came to things like the aea issue and we were able to work with all interested parties to think really land in really good place grassley said not every single priority that laid out but some of those really high profile ones we were able to advance the ball on those education has been front and center in reynolds legislative agendas in recent years and last year she guided the passage of private school choice program that is expected to cost the state 179 million next year this year reynolds initial plan for the area education agencies would have eliminated their services outside special education support and diverted nearly all their funding to school districts the districts would then have had the option to contract with the aeas or an outside party for those services after hearing from parents of students with disabilities and concerned educators republicans landed on proposal that will require schools spend 90 of their special education funding with the aeas districts will eventually receive the full amount that the aeas now receive for media and education services and they will have broad discretion over where and how to spend those dollars community members sit on the floor of an overflow room to watch the aea hearing at the iowa state capitol in des moines iowa on wednesday feb 21 2024 reynolds said previously the final law which she signed in march was phenomenal place to start toward restructuring special education delivery the aea redesign will really bring transparency consistency and accountability to the process reynolds said last week for democrats reynolds education agenda has been constant target of criticism as they ve argued recent policies have transferred large swaths of tax dollars from public schools to unaccountable private institutions democrats pointed to the dozens of aea staff who have either resigned or retired this year citing the new law as motivating reason imagine what will happen next year konfrst said so many unintended consequences here and will really continue to hurt our rural communities especially in rural iowa when you ve got small districts the aeas provide those services that can otherwise be afforded because you ve got one child who needs them reynolds said the aea system is changing as result of the law but she noted it will be slow transition as funding for media services education services and special education gradually change hands over the next two years some of the staff leaving the aeas she said will likely be employed at the state department of education under the new special education division that will oversee the agencies lawmakers transferred 10 million from the aeas this year to the education department which will in part support 62 new full time employees for special education oversight it still going to be bumpy m not naive reynolds said but they really want to provide the best service that they can for the kids so we re putting the kids front and center when you do that you ll be surprised at where we can go reynolds also made literacy instruction focus this year she proposed bill that would allow parents to hold students back in school if they are not reading proficiently by third grade and require massachusetts reading instruction test of all teachers educated at iowa public universities though that bill saw some changes in the legislature it for students who are behind and allowing parents to hold student back who is not reading at grade level reynolds has not yet signed the bill into law it makes all the difference in the world and so we want to make sure that our teachers have the tools with the science of reading she said m really excited about the effort that we put into that reynolds proposed several health care and social services initiatives this year including reorganizing the state behavioral health system extending postpartum medicaid coverage while lowering the eligibility threshold and making two of those proposals that did not pass were the birth control measure and proposal to provide reynolds said she was disappointed the paid leave bill did not pass which she proposed for the second time this year what century do we live in for heaven sake reynolds said they get nothing want young people to experience the opportunity to work for state government and to serve iowans the bill would have given four weeks of paid leave to an employee who gave birth and one week to new parent who did not reynolds said she intends to propose the bill again next year one of reynolds agenda items that passed which she has not yet signed into law will allow under medicaid for 12 months after giving birth an increase from the two months currently offered the bill will change the income threshold for pregnant women to qualify for medicaid coverage from 375 of the poverty line the most generous in the nation to 215 an estimated 1 700 women and infants will no longer qualify for medicaid coverage each month under the new eligibility level the which reynolds has not yet signed will eliminate iowa existing mental health and substance use treatment networks and bring the services under unified behavioral health network with seven regions administered by local agencies draft of the seven proposed behavioral health districts under gov kim reynolds reorganization bill reynolds health officials said during the session that money for those services was not being efficiently spent and centralizing the system will improve service delivery reynolds proposed one of several competing proposals to spend money out of the state opioid settlement fund which holds more than 25 million won in lawsuits with companies over their role in the opioid crisis the bill called for around 20 million in spending on specific projects lawmakers debated different proposals in the final hours of the session this year leaving the funds unspent for the second year in row later in the session reynolds proposed bill that would in state law to reflect person sex assigned at birth which did not get passed by lawmakers the bill caused an outcry from transgender and lgbtq iowans who said it was an attempt to erase transgender people and discriminate against them an early version of the bill would have required transgender person driver license to include both their pre and post transition sex that bill passed out of house committee but it was not brought up for vote and died before the session ended following up on large government reorganization law she signed last year reynolds proposed bill this year to reorganize the boards and commissions that oversee administrative rules and large swaths of the state government rather than taking up reynolds bill house republicans proposed much slimmer bill that would only eliminate the boards and commissions that had bipartisan consensus through negotiations with senate republicans who took up reynolds bill that will eliminate or merge more than 70 boards and commissions among those boards being eliminated are minority focused commissions serving the african american community asians and pacific islanders native americans latinos women and persons with disabilities the bill also takes rulemaking authorities away from several boards vesting it instead in the executive agencies that oversee them which report to the governor it just kind of follows along what we ve been trying to do to streamline state government reynolds said of the bill as scrutiny increases among national policymakers over entities from countries like china owning land in the s reynolds proposed and signed bill that increases restrictions on foreign owners of agricultural land iowa law already has significant restrictions on foreign entities that own farmland the more to state officials and gives the attorney general more power to investigate and punish entities that don comply iowa gov kim

27,0e28901c93aa0b8aba2521528d22662a,How did Iowa Gov. Kim Renyolds' legislative agenda fare this year? What passed and failed,https://qctimes.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/kim-reynolds-iowa-legislature-area-education-agencies-tax-cuts-health-care/article_a6e4db8e-0988-11ef-9a69-a75b87ea7d29.html,qctimes,https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/qctimes.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/8/7b/87b696f6-c6c8-11ee-9388-d32c16cc146d/65c546e99eea3.image.png?resize=300%2C224,des moines speaking to iowa lawmakers at the beginning of this year legislative session gov kim reynolds promised bold vision for the state raising teacher pay overhauling area education agencies cutting taxes and reorganizing large health care and administrative systems reynolds republican proposed more than dozen bills this year dealing with health care education economic growth and the structure of government reynolds was able to usher in many of her proposals largely as written with large republican majorities in the house and senate that are generally supportive of her policy agenda other bills though saw major changes in the lawmaking process and some bills that lawmakers have rejected before failed to pass again the cornerstone of reynolds agenda this year was plan to reorganize the funding and function of the state area education agencies which provide special education support to school districts the bill met significant resistance within her own party as house republicans initially tabled the bill in subcommittee compromise eventually passed with significant changes retaining the aeas as the primary special education providers in the state that law also set the starting salary for teachers at 50 000 by 2026 increasing starting pay for iowa teachers from the bottom half in the nation to among the highest in the 50 states current starting salary for teachers is 33 500 reynolds also proposed major tax bill that would have set flat income tax at 3 5 by next year that bill saw significant changes as well leading republican lawmakers settled on plan that sets 3 8 flat tax next year which reynolds signed into law last week iowa gov kim reynolds signs into law legislation that will reduce working iowans state income taxes during ceremony in the governor formal office at the iowa capitol in des moines on wednesday may 1 2024 other tax measures in reynolds bill including changes to the unemployment tax employers pay and cutting property taxes for child care centers did not make it into the final law during news conference on wednesday reynolds said she felt good about the results of this year session she said her office was working on nearly 20 bills going into the legislative session joking that it was way too many we took on lot and really feel good about where we landed reynolds said m really proud of the fact that we passed the largest teacher salary increase in the history of the state democrats argued during the session this year that reynolds agenda was politically motivated and did not address the major needs of iowans in areas like housing health care and wages they took specific aim at the aea changes saying they served corporate interests and would weaken special education in iowa house minority leader jennifer konfrst windsor heights noted as the session came to close that republican lawmakers did not come into the session with aea reform as major goal the governor runs this building with republicans her agenda her politics always center stage konfrst said continue to remind my colleagues that we are separate branch of government and that we don work for the governor but the republican leadership and republican legislators sure act like we do iowa house democratic leader jennifer konfrst of windsor heights speaks with reporters saturday april 20 2024 during the last day of the 2024 iowa legislative session konfrst said the session had been defined by republicans making life harder for iowans in areas like voting economic opportunity and special education house speaker pat grassley signaled support for reynolds policy agenda as the session ended but he noted lawmakers reviewed and made changes to some of her proposals the governor laid out very bold agenda when it came to things like the aea issue and we were able to work with all interested parties to think really land in really good place grassley said not every single priority that laid out but some of those really high profile ones we were able to advance the ball on those education has been front and center in reynolds legislative agendas in recent years and last year she guided the passage of private school choice program that is expected to cost the state 179 million next year this year reynolds initial plan for the area education agencies would have eliminated their services outside special education support and diverted nearly all their funding to school districts the districts would then have had the option to contract with the aeas or an outside party for those services after hearing from parents of students with disabilities and concerned educators republicans landed on proposal that will require schools spend 90 of their special education funding with the aeas districts will eventually receive the full amount that the aeas now receive for media and education services and they will have broad discretion over where and how to spend those dollars community members sit on the floor of an overflow room to watch the aea hearing at the iowa state capitol in des moines iowa on wednesday feb 21 2024 reynolds said previously the final law which she signed in march was phenomenal place to start toward restructuring special education delivery the aea redesign will really bring transparency consistency and accountability to the process reynolds said last week for democrats reynolds education agenda has been constant target of criticism as they ve argued recent policies have transferred large swaths of tax dollars from public schools to unaccountable private institutions democrats pointed to the dozens of aea staff who have either resigned or retired this year citing the new law as motivating reason imagine what will happen next year konfrst said so many unintended consequences here and will really continue to hurt our rural communities especially in rural iowa when you ve got small districts the aeas provide those services that can otherwise be afforded because you ve got one child who needs them reynolds said the aea system is changing as result of the law but she noted it will be slow transition as funding for media services education services and special education gradually change hands over the next two years some of the staff leaving the aeas she said will likely be employed at the state department of education under the new special education division that will oversee the agencies lawmakers transferred 10 million from the aeas this year to the education department which will in part support 62 new full time employees for special education oversight it still going to be bumpy m not naive reynolds said but they really want to provide the best service that they can for the kids so we re putting the kids front and center when you do that you ll be surprised at where we can go reynolds also made literacy instruction focus this year she proposed bill that would allow parents to hold students back in school if they are not reading proficiently by third grade and require massachusetts reading instruction test of all teachers educated at iowa public universities though that bill saw some changes in the legislature it retained components requiring schools to create personalized reading plans for students who are behind and allowing parents to hold student back who is not reading at grade level reynolds has not yet signed the bill into law it makes all the difference in the world and so we want to make sure that our teachers have the tools with the science of reading she said m really excited about the effort that we put into that reynolds proposed several health care and social services initiatives this year including reorganizing the state behavioral health system extending postpartum medicaid coverage while lowering the eligibility threshold and making birth control available without prescription two of those proposals that did not pass were the birth control measure and proposal to provide paid parental leave to state employees reynolds said she was disappointed the paid leave bill did not pass which she proposed for the second time this year what century do we live in for heaven sake reynolds said they get nothing want young people to experience the opportunity to work for state government and to serve iowans the bill would have given four weeks of paid leave to an employee who gave birth and one week to new parent who did not reynolds said she intends to propose the bill again next year one of reynolds agenda items that passed which she has not yet signed into law will allow some new mothers to receive postpartum care under medicaid for 12 months after giving birth an increase from the two months currently offered the bill will change the income threshold for pregnant women to qualify for medicaid coverage from 375 of the poverty line the most generous in the nation to 215 an estimated 1 700 women and infants will no longer qualify for medicaid coverage each month under the new eligibility level the behavioral health system redesign which reynolds has not yet signed will eliminate iowa existing mental health and substance use treatment networks and bring the services under unified behavioral health network with seven regions administered by local agencies draft of the seven proposed behavioral health districts under gov kim reynolds reorganization bill reynolds health officials said during the session that money for those services was not being efficiently spent and centralizing the system will improve service delivery reynolds proposed one of several competing proposals to spend money out of the state opioid settlement fund which holds more than 25 million won in lawsuits with companies over their role in the opioid crisis the bill called for around 20 million in spending on specific projects lawmakers debated different proposals in the final hours of the session this year but failed to reach an agreement leaving the funds unspent for the second year in row later in the session reynolds proposed bill that would define terms like man woman male and female in state law to reflect person sex assigned at birth which did not get passed by lawmakers the bill caused an outcry from transgender and lgbtq iowans who said it was an attempt to erase transgender people and discriminate against them an early version of the bill would have required transgender person driver license to include both their pre and post transition sex that bill passed out of house committee but it was not brought up for vote and died before the session ended following up on large government reorganization law she signed last year reynolds proposed bill this year to reorganize the boards and commissions that oversee administrative rules and large swaths of the state government rather than taking up reynolds bill house republicans proposed much slimmer bill that would only eliminate the boards and commissions that had bipartisan consensus through negotiations with senate republicans who took up reynolds bill lawmakers passed an agreement that will eliminate or merge more than 70 boards and commissions among those boards being eliminated are minority focused commissions serving the african american community asians and pacific islanders native americans latinos women and persons with disabilities the bill also takes rulemaking authorities away from several boards vesting it instead in the executive agencies that oversee them which report to the governor it just kind of follows along what we ve been trying to do to streamline state government reynolds said of the bill as scrutiny increases among national policymakers over entities from countries like china owning land in the s reynolds proposed and signed bill that increases restrictions on foreign owners of agricultural land iowa law already has significant restrictions on foreign entities that own farmland the new law requires foreign owners of farmland to report more to state officials and gives the attorney general more power to investigate and punish entities that don comply iowa gov kim reynolds signs into law legislation that will require more transparency in foreign ownership of iowa farm

28,880c2f2e4d5f2a14828c7dbdc1b18702,"Transcript: Queen Rania al Abdullah of Jordan on ""Face the Nation,"" May 5, 2024",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/queen-rania-al-abdullah-jordan-face-the-nation-05-025-2024/,cbsnews,https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/05/04/4a740876-1d8b-4b4c-aa41-8b8e02567cee/thumbnail/60x60/2994dd1992b1b89450b9bc19834b5c43/0503-en-brennan.jpg?v=1d6c78a71b7b6252b543a329b3a5744d,the following is transcript of an interview with queen rania al abdullah of jordan that aired on may 5 2024 margaret brennan your majesty thank you for making time for us queen rania al abdullah thank you it a pleasure to be here margaret brennan jordan has two field hospitals inside of gaza jordan is helping to get aid into the strip the un estimates that at least 15 000 children have been killed since this war began in october what is the impact in the region queen rania well look first of all gaza in the last seven months has become unrecognizable cities have turned into wasteland growing happy children have been reduced to skin and bone 2 3 million people in short in small area have been going through hell every single day 1 7 million of them have been displaced and not just one some of them several times and they re currently living in conditions that are unimaginable in makeshift shelters in tents on the street unicef was hearing from teenage girls saying that they would rather be killed than live under these conditions and so many have been killed almost 35 000 people 70 of them women and children as you mentioned almost 15 000 children gaza has the highest unfortunately sadly the highest cohort of child amputees and every couple of days we re losing children to starvation we in the arab world have been seeing this war live streamed every single day and it has become central to our lives and it been quite devastating and the impact has been obviously people are so traumatized by what they re seeing every day we were traumatized by october 7 but then this war we feel is not you know israel is saying that this was defensive war obviously it was instigated by october 7 but the way it being fought is not in defensive way you know 60 of homes have been destroyed 80 of schools and health care centers have been destroyed are we to believe that they were hamas operatives and each one of those you know so so you know the the impact has been very very big on us and think people m not sure if your viewers know this but people view the s as being party to this war because you know israeli officials say that without us support they couldn launch this war you know you turn off the tap and the weapons dry out so and so there has been anger in our part of the world not just what what happening but at the world reaction when we see these violations human rights violations and international law violations and we re watching the world letting it happen when october 7th happened the world rightfully condemned and took strong actions strong positions we are outraged that the same is not happening when palestinians are getting killed and so there is sense of the selective application of humanitarian law and sense of unfairness sense of our lives don matter as much and you know this is something think that creating certainly causing great loss of credibility to the us but also causing us to rethink our our view of the world order you know as cruel and and ugly as the war in gaza is the state of our rules based world order is looking exponentially worse people are looking at gaza as reflection of the rest of the world where you know the rules don matter where international law doesn matter where un resolutions can be ignored and think that sets very very dangerous precedent because actions like these they re not only betrayal for the people of gaza but they re actually betrayal of the safeguards that are meant to keep us all safe margaret brennan you said people back home see the united states as complicit in what happening queen rania they see it as an enabler you know so clearly the us is the country that has most leverage over the us over israel and like said you know it is the biggest ally and biggest supporter and the arab world is getting the rest of the world actually is getting mixed messages on the one hand the us is demanding that more aid rightfully go back into gaza at the same time they re they re denying that the starvation is intentional on the one hand they are outraged by the attacks on the aid convoys but at the same time they re denying that israel is violating international humanitarian law there an expression of concern over civilian deaths but at the same time there a provision of offensive weapons to israel that are used against palestinians so in sense you know you when you try so hard to thread the needle you can risk dropping the ball you can risk letting your values and principles unravel and and that has deep impact so for example even when the us allowed the un security council resolution on the ceasefire to pass the next day there was an announcement saying that it not it not legally binding un resolutions are absolutely legally binding and these legal frameworks are there to ensure that all countries adhere to standards of conduct they re either applicable to everyone or they re not either everyone is accountable or no one is so the next time country breaks rules you know and the us comes and tries to apply more authority those countries are going to say well you made an exception here so why apply it to us so think people you know we are seeing israel falling short of moral standard after moral stand legal standard after legal standard and the world is refusing to act so think gaza now is like microcosm of our new world disorder of the breakdown of international norms of the return of might is right and think that very dangerous not just for our region but for the entire world margaret brennan you know recently president biden just about month ago warned prime minister netanyahu that us policy would change if israel behavior and conduct in this war didn change do you believe the us is starting to use the leverage you say it has queen rania well look there definitely been change in tone and language and you re right the president has been warning and has been trying very hard to persuade netanyahu for example to not enter rafah but we ve seen time and again israeli officials not heeding the warnings or counsel or advice of allies so think it time that the international community including the us really use this political leverage to compel israel to end the war and to let aid in margaret brennan how queen rania it an it by taking measures right so again it by standing up for international law saying for example the building of illegal settlements is is wrong and it has to stop it by saying that you know we re not going to provide you with offensive weapons it by saying we re not going to continue to use our veto to not hold israel accountable accountable when it breaks the law diplomatic pressure is also very very important so there are many tools that the us has in order to compel israel to do the right thing and think for the sake of our world the us may be israel most closest ally but good friend holds friend accountable you don give them carte blanche when they re not doing the right thing and think it does israel great disservice when we don hold it accountable because it creates culture of impunity and that has been the situation for decades where they feel that they can they can be the exception to every international law and standard either you re part of the international community and you abide by the rules or you re pariah state that not that made an exception to every rule so so think that if you care about your ally you will actually take action to set them and that will be for israel best interest in the long term margaret brennan in the beginning of this war you were outspoken about the humanitarian concerns very early on and you are the queen of jordan but you re also palestinian queen rania right margaret brennan you argued people need to understand that palestinian mothers love their children just as much as israeli mothers why do you feel like that needed to be said queen rania well because you know for decades the dehumanization of palestinians has been an intentional approach that israel adopted in order to numb people to palestinian suffering you know it actually quite surprising to see just how deep the undercurrents of dehumanization has run israelis have pretty much you know arabs are generally accused of teaching hate palestinians as well but it israelis have actually walled palestinians out of sight and out of mind it kind of reduced them to nameless faceless security threats that you have to defend yourself against they don learn about palestinians they re never introduced to them as real people any attempts to bring palestinian stories into books are are barred so this sense of and we actually saw that you know among the people blocking aid into palestinians were young teenagers can understand how anybody could be so indifferent to human suffering margaret brennan you re talking now about some of the protests that are trying to interrupt the shipment of aid into gaza queen rania m talking about deep culture an omnipresent perspective about palestinians that says that palestinians are subhuman that they are violent because of something intrinsic in them it something in their nature it it it not because there is violence inflicted on them and so when you reduce people to violent people who are different to us so they re not moral like us so therefore it okay to inflict pain and suffering on them because they don feel it the same way we do it allows people to do bad things that that the mental loophole of dehumanization it allows you to justify the unjustifiable to do bad things and still see yourself as good person and we re seeing that happen in the case of palestinians they don feel the palestinians that why said the mothers love their children the same way because you know it allows you to do bad things and not really have moral dilemma with it and that what what happening but you know dehumanization works both ways because when you lose your ability to empathize towards the other side you become hardened yourself it degrades your own your own humanity and we re seeing this happening in israeli society where they re become so hardened and just want to urge people to to understand that this narrative this propaganda that been fed this anti palestinian racism that palestinians do not want peace that palestinians only understand the language of violence and force that is incorrect margaret brennan to see hamas as representing palestinian people you re saying is wrong queen rania absolutely wrong and also just to just to point out that most of the people alive in gaza today were not alive when hamas was elected they were either child they were not born or they were children at the time so absolutely hamas does not represent the majority of of palestinians and if palestinians hate israelis it is not because of their religion or their identity it because of the fact that they ve only interacted with them as enforcers of military state they have only known them to their check checkpoints and bullets and guns it not something that inherently in them against jewish people in fact always try to remind people that you know we have coexisted christians muslims and jewish people for the longest time that where the three monotheistic religions were born and prior to the birth of zionism the muslim majority in palestine lived in complete friendship and tolerance with the with the jewish minority there was never an issue of antisemitism there margaret brennan well you know historians will argue antisemitism has been present throughout history right and it is hard for people to hear some of what you re saying and not react in that way where they hear characterization of criticism of the israeli government or the israeli military and see where you re separating from jewish people lot of people don hear difference queen rania antisemitism is absolutely present and it and it been on the rise it been on the surge and it is the worst kind of bigotry it is pure hatred and always say that muslims have to be have to be at the forefront of fighting antisemitism because islamophobia is the other side of the same disease and it also on the rise judaism is religion of peace it is the first of the three monotheistic religions and as muslims you know we it was it was judaism christianity and islam we all believe in the same god and the issue is when you try to conflate anti israeli policy with antisemitism right antisemitism is when you persecute somebody or you discriminate against somebody based on their jewish identity israel is state it has political policy political parties so you can criticize the state of israel but that not necessarily antisemitism so when people stand up and speak against the war in gaza when they re talking about the speak against the collective punishment when you deprive people of food as weapon of war when when entire populations displaced when there indiscriminate bombing that is not antisemitism that is speaking against israeli policy and think it would be wrong to hold the jewish community responsible for the actions of the or the policies of israel and many jewish people absolutely reject this this conflation they didn they they they want to protect their jewish identity and say that they the jewish faith has existed 3 000 years before the birth of the state of israel so it it predates the state of israel and and it inaudible to conflate the religious aspect with the politics don think it serves anybody and it certainly doesn bring us closer to peace margaret brennan well let me ask you about that because you know there are protests at colleges across the united states here in new york other cities in solidarity with palestinians in gaza but there is also this perception among some students that they are unsafe because they are for example jewish students what do you think of the protests and are you surprised to see young americans protesting like this queen rania first of all think it important to point out that law and order are paramount for everybody and so it it is important for students to abide by the rules of the campus to not disrupt classes to not disrupt other students exper college experience at the same time as said there is rise in antisemitism and it wrong for any student to have to feel unsafe on campus that being said we need to emotions are running high and think people are are losing sight of what these these students are protesting for them the issue of gaza and the palestinian conflict is more about social justice they are standing up for human rights for international law for the principles that underpin international law they re standing up for the future that they re going to inherit so they re asking their universities to divest from an illegal occupation but at the same time may maybe more importantly they are suggesting that there is more to the story than we have been told that there is that the narrative that we have been fed that that that israel is the victim and the palestinians are are violent people who deserve what happening to them that that is not the entire story margaret brennan why do you think that happening on college campuses why do you think young people feel this way queen rania well actually it a lot of people feel this way but college campuses have always been the site of of activism you know young students are learning about these issues at that age you want to stand up you re more idealistic you want to stand up for values you believe in you re you re outraged when when things are not going right when when when what you re taught and what you believe should be the right thing isn happening and so they re expressing their views but think to to paint all these students and all these protests in in broad paintbrush and to vilify them as being you know pro hamas or pro terrorism or antisemitic think that inaccurate and think it it somewhat patronizing to some of these students because lot of people were saying well you know they don even know what they re protesting they re just protesting for the sake of it lot of them are well read thoughtful young individuals who know exactly what they re protesting they are protesting for justice and margaret brennan do you think it will change us foreign policy queen rania well i don i don know if it will change us foreign policy it certainly grassroots movement and an ex expression of generation that feel that there is contradiction between the values and principles that they were taught that this country stands for and what actually happening on the ground and again let not forget that there are substantial number of jewish students who are involved in these protests and the vast majority of these protests want to be peaceful they don want to be destructive and think the most important thing is to have genuine engagement with with with the students to have an open debate to hear from them and and explain to them mean lot of times they re saying well these kids you need education think we need to go into this knowing that we need education as well so it a give and take and we saw an example in brown university where that kind of healthy debate ended up you know sort of calming things down and where it was win win situation so the more you use force think the more that inflames the situation margaret brennan how are young people in jordan thinking about this right now mean what is the sentiment in terms of the american unconditional support for the government of israel queen rania have to say in one word there outrage you know there is outrage because you know for most young people even those who maybe were against american foreign policy or whatever disagreed with it we always looked up to the us you know as country of democratic country with democratic values with application of law with freedom of speech with you know human rights etc and as said you know the young people are now feeling extremely disillusioned how can this be happening while the us is allowing it to happen while the rest of the world is is allowing it to happen blatant disregard for international law and and and just you know when the us when when israel says you know that we are not targeting civilians and then you look at the reality on the ground that we re seeing with our own two eyes and we re seeing and by the admission of some israeli intelligence sources they were saying that they often attacked their targets at night in their homes with their families which has led to the deaths of thousands of women and children we have seen wild widely spread reports about israel using ai systems to generate the largest number of targets prioritizing quantity over quality and so the really by taking humanity out of the equation in their calculus it okay to flatten the entire neighborhood or kill the entire family to get one target and so the whole principle of proportionality and distinction between between civilians and combatants has been abandoned in this war and you know when when israelis are telling us you know they re dying because hamas is using them as human shields well you know you have place like like gaza which is one of the most densely populated places in the world being hit by an unprecedented number of dumb bombs which are untargeted unguided bombs or massive bombs which are the 2000 pound bombs to put in perspective in fighting isis the us only used one such bomb because it known that it has very high risk of killing civilians so you hit the most densely populated place on earth with an unprecedented number of unguided bombs and mass of bombs and we are supposed to believe that israel is trying to avoid killing civilians it just doesn it doesn add up margaret brennan you ve had protests in jordan queen rania yes margaret brennan outside embassies and alike amnesty international says jordanian security arrested at least 1 500 people for protesting why are you concerned there is threat to the stability of jordan queen rania not at all we know since the beginning of this war we ve had thousands of people go out think we ve had about 1700 demonstrations of people going out advocating and and standing out in solidarity with the palestinian people and you know at the end of the day jordan and most of these demonstrations have been friction free with the police and but the end end of the day jordan is country of law and order so as long as people abide are abiding by the law as said with the demonstrations here then they are free to protest it only when we see vandalism or attacks on public and private property that the security forces obviously have responsibility to come in to step in but again jordan has been probably at the forefront of countries that have stood up and spoken openly about in defense of what happening and you know in defense of palestinians and that not just the leadership but that also the people themselves the people the government and the leadership so we re we re on the same page on this margaret brennan well the director of national intelligence in this country avril haines testified saying there will be generational impact from the war in gaza and that was also gesture to terror recruitment how concerned are you that that is what may happen to some of these young people who you say are just inundated with images of what happening queen rania you know like said it it not just the people who are on the extreme that that are being enraged by this it people who are in the middle as well people who are westernized people who studied here people who who are suddenly just looking at the world and saying you know they re so the solution they re saying you know clearly there are different standards that humanitarian law is applied selectively and that our lives don matter and that it okay for for you know almost 15 000 children to be killed 19 000 to be orphaned it okay for for you know the infrastructure to be obliterated it okay to use to stop the delivery of aid and food to an entire population that is collective punishment it a war crime and it happening and so the young people are saying you know guess the west doesn like us so so in my opinion this is probably one of the most radical large sorry largest recruitment event that we ve seen in recent history because it turned lot of people away and it making people feel like there just no justice in this world and that is very dangerous place to be margaret brennan that is what you are describing is what defense secretary austin warned israel about that you could have tactical win and strategic loss in the long term that what hear you saying that this will lead to more terror recruitment queen rania absolutely and again do not need to ask ourselves this the simple question is this war making israel safer is it making our world safer you know would argue after 35 000 people dead after the obliteration of the civilian infrastructure in in gaza after the violations of so much after the rhetoric that we re hearing you know from israeli officials calling palestinians human animals or saying when the prime minister says that palestinians are children of darkness that they only understand the rules of the jungle you know when officials say we need to find more effective way than death to inflict suffering on palestinians how is that making israel safer mean you know how this is we need to create peace is not about politics only it about people it about culture it about state of mind it about choosing tolerance over suspicion it about choosing compromise and reconciliation over the false promise of victory and the politics inside of israel has shifted so far to the right that it become acceptable israelis are surprised when the word genocide is used because they cannot see palestinians as anything but as security threat that they deserve what happening to them you know in poll margaret brennan they re traumatized after october 7 many israelis queen rania absolutely traumatized understand that and understand that because of my own background that would identify with the palestinian side more and because of that challenge myself every single day to put myself in the shoes of an israeli mother who is who has child that been taken as hostage or or any young israeli who has been taught and who heard of the horrible persecution that the jewish people had to endure in europe and and tried to empathize and see where they re coming from and absolutely you know we need the hostages to go home as soon as possible and we need the war to end as soon as possible so that palestinians can go back to their homes if they have homes left so understand that that what happened on october 7 was traumatic and devastating for israeli society but the reaction to it has not helped the situation you cannot just rely on your this visceral reaction of retribution and revenge because then you re just you know you re just going into the cycle of violence and just digging deeper in it and it just going to keep getting worse the israel could have retaliated through surgical strikes against hamas but that not what we re seeing today you know we are seeing war that is not fought in defensive way margaret brennan when you were at the white house in february president biden mentioned that your husband king abdullah and two of your children had participated in airdrops in gaza but you ve referred to the airdrops as just drops in an ocean what is needed at this point to reverse the famine in north gaza queen rania right so so you know those airdrops were just acts of desperation and my husband said from day one they are inefficient they re costly and they do not begin to meet the needs of the people of gaza but in our calculus it was anything is better than nothing right and you know the hunger figures in the gaza are unprecedented every single person in gaza is hungry quarter of the population is starving and when we saw that devastating attack on the world central kitchens there was lot of pressure on israel to allow more food and aid into gaza there been slight uptick but really at the end of the day there they re not even close to meeting the needs of margaret brennan well who could distribute that if if the war ended even would jordan be able to come in and help with reconstruction queen rania so this is so so so this is the thing you know think what that strike did for example was stop aid make lots of agencies suspend their operations because they didn feel safe working in gaza and this after israel has has has bombed flower fields agricultural land fishing boats basically decimating gaza ability to feed itself not just today but for years to come and so what is required is permanent ceasefire that allows the hostages to go back home and people to go back to their homes we need to put pressure on israel to open all access points and the land access is the most efficient way to deliver aid at at scale we just streamline the vetting process which now is so complicated and arbitrary and and you know they could find one thing in truck that they re don approve and the whole truck has to go back and and the last thing is that we need to allow aid workers safe access within gaza so that they can actually deliver the aid to the people that need it but if we do not flood gaza with aid soon then we are going to be facing mass famine and don know how the world just is happy doing that it just it it a major stain on our global consciousness to see this happening in slow motion and not do something about it margaret brennan jordan has had peace treaty with israel since 1994 if israel goes into southern gaza into rafa as the prime minister says he intends to do will peace hold queen rania as you said we ve had peace with israel since 94 and jordan always honors the commitments that it signs up to in peace agreements we will always be on the side of peace and diplomacy but but diplomacy requires trust and lot of that trust has been eroded over the years because of violations against people in gaza and the west bank and and because of the undermining of the jordanian custodianship of the christian and muslim sites in jerusalem which are part of this agreement margaret brennan what do you mean by that what happened queen rania well time and again you know we have violations against christian sites and muslim sites by israeli troops who are not allowing people to go in who are arresting people who are not allowing people to pray we re seeing that happening all the time and so this is constantly undermining the hashemite role and custodianship of these holy sites and so so there is an issue with that and with it comes when when it comes to rafah the world you know there are ongoing daily strikes on rafah as we speak but if there was to be full scale invasion then you know the world has warned that there will be blood bloodbath for the simple reason that half the population of gaza is now sheltering in rafah we re talking about 50 000 people per square mile and since the beginning of this war there was they were pushed systematically further and further south rafah is the end of the line there nowhere else for them to go there only six square mile piece of land that could could be considered safe zone so they have nowhere to go and don know how israel could go in surgically without causing massive number of civilian deaths and so think the world really needs to compel israel not to do it margaret brennan your majesty thank you for your time m being told we are out of time queen rania thank you more from cbs news military concludes airstrike in syria

communities?",https://www.denverpost.com/2024/05/05/transit-oriented-communities-colorado-legislation-density-requirements/,denverpost,https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/tdp-z-opcolumn_d3afab.jpg?w=1400px&strip=all,union station has been transit hub since 1881 it thrived for 70 years with intercity travelers who transferred from heavy rail to street cars to get home then land use patterns and transportation habits changed housing arose in suburban communities connected by interstate highways and automobiles came to dominate the roads and family budgets union station limped along for the intervening 50 years new housing including an affordable building required by the city was built across mostly impassable rail tracks in the central platte valley but none immediately adjacent the station served amtrak the rtd line and couple of busses but few riders that is until four government entities implemented vision for community in lower downtown centered on transit with union station as rail and bus hub and supported by thousands of new homes to boost ridership the new density in this transit oriented community has supported grocery stores farmers markets restaurants and thriving neighborhood in lodo as moved from being an advocate to union station board member to city council eventually helped ensure who worked there it easy to see the housing transit connection at fancy union station but cities across our state have or are looking to replicate much smaller three to five story models think about transit oriented communities like mason corridor in fort collins the mature boulder junction and arvada town center and imagine the possibilities at the mccaslin park ride in superior gov jared polis and state legislators want to speed that process with legislation to ensure 31 cities with frequent transit in the denver metro area plus colorado springs and fort collins have zoning in place to support more housing along transit hubs transit oriented communities toc bill that would create moderate density around transit is pending at the capitol it is part of package to ease the housing crisis through zoning reforms by spurring new supply and improving housing affordability for coloradans the approach could also guarantee long term affordable units if companion bill passes that allocates 30 million in new tax credits for building housing priced for families earning less than 60 50 or even 30 of the median income that translates into incomes below 60 000 depending on household size and county of residence more broadly even adding market rate multi family housing near transit will save residents money and trigger expanded access to lower priced apartments however using hb 1313 to require builders to include some on site affordability while they build up could reach even more coloradans needing rents below market rate faster economic evidence supports both greater density and building affordable housing near transit minimum density is needed to boost ridership which brings in more fares to strengthen transit agencies and help stabilize or improve service for all riders low and moderate income families earning less than 55 000 spend 60 or more of their income on the combined costs of housing and transportation they save 9 on transportation if they live in walkable transit rich community with amenities because they re the most likely to ditch cars for transit the combination also reduces greenhouse gas emissions slowing the climate change that has brought killer heat wildfires and melting snowpack to colorado the question of how market rate k likely to be expensive housing in transit oriented communities helps ease the crisis is more complex but there a reason for optimism in the counties that the toc bill covers attached housing like condos and duplexes sell for an average of 204 000 less than single family home according to my research as fellow for the bell policy institute condos are certain to be allowed under the densities required local governments may also average zoning for much taller buildings with less dense zoning meaning townhome configurations could also help meet the minimum density in some scenarios the toc legislation has the potential to expand homeownership at lower prices than new single family construction and if nonprofits and cities can secure parcels within these transit oriented communities to put in land trust model it would help expand homeownership among more moderate income families land trusts hold the land under building in community ownership where it does not appreciate and the units built or existing on the land are often price and income restricted there is extensive research on the effect new apartments have on surrounding rents and affordability older methods have associated new competition with lower rents only as older housing in the community aged over several decades newer evidence finds modest price decreases of 100 to 159 in the immediate vicinity of new buildings right away 0 2 miles even more promising results document vacancies opening up in lower priced apartments quickly which are taken advantage of by larger share of renters with lower incomes at each successive move that is triggered the phenomenon is often compared to musical chairs chairs open up for those with lower incomes because some workers are renting down in homes costing less than they could really afford in places with an overall shortage when workers who can afford to rent new apartments stand up and move they open up chairs down the price and income spectrum in popular colorado destinations local protections against diverting new homes for short term rentals would increase the chances of replicating these outcomes yet according to an interim housing needs assessment by the denver regional council of governments 60 of new housing or 137 00 dwellings will be needed for working families earning less than 60 of median income by 2040 100 break on 2 500 rent still won be affordable for them we can expand on apartments loosened up through moves by building mixed income affordable housing as percentage of any market homes being built on day one states and cities in california and massachusetts are leading on similar zoning changes and both have state or local policies that pair density with affordability requirements typically 10 or more of the units in new construction must be below market rates colorado or local governments should too part 4 of this series will dive deeper into this so called inclusionary housing model and we must mitigate against the risk of displacement that can still accompany new housing development in vulnerable communities public or community land ownership is leading strategy for doing so as is getting more renters into homeownership inside the colorado capitol the debates over house bill 1313 have been dominated by insider baseball chicken egg questions should we reform zoning first or improve transit frequency what should the formula in the bill be to determine the density of these communities and should we include penalty in the bill that links transportation funding to compliance for now the bill doesn include the penalty what most coloradans likely care about more is whether housing will match the character of their communities and if it will help the crisis according to recent polls statewide support for more density near transit ranged from half to two thirds while generic density didn scare off poll respondents it does some opponents when residents are presented with real life transit oriented scenarios during hands on planning exercises they embrace the walkable communities it creates like when 1 300 fort collins residents were shown communities with denser than average housing near transit in city that struggled to pass zoning reforms at the policy level the majority of residents preferred the scenario with the greatest concentration of infill development with high frequency transit service when they were looking at it more media coverage of what comparable 3 4 story models look and feel like when covering debates would help bridge an important gap ultimately upzoned transit oriented communities with housing funding can align with both the affordability and quality of life interests of broad swaths of coloradans implementing proactive protections against displacement in vulnerable communities as called for in the bill along with the newly signed protection against eviction without cause will help mitigate risks passing the 30 million tax credit for affordable housing with the toc bill and demanding that percentage of newly built units are affordable up front as seven of the 31 cities that are the subject of the bill already do would expand outcomes for even more struggling coloradans ,['robinkniech'],99

Constitution,https://www.dailycamera.com/2024/05/05/editorial-defunct-same-sex-marriage-ban-has-no-place-in-colorado-constitution/,dailycamera,https://www.dailycamera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/TDP-L-RosePugliese012524-cha-162.jpg?w=1400px&strip=all,for long time it has felt like our country is steadily marching toward progress what exactly progress is though is tricky to define and ephemeral progress after all is in the eye of the beholder and tends to change along with our culture but for the purposes of this argument let say progress is the march toward equality toward racial justice toward gender parity toward lgbtq rights progress toward these goals has never been steady but it is nonetheless important to realize that our society and our country have made headway this is not an effort at rose tinted revisionism nor for that matter an implication that we are on backslide the fact of the matter is that the progress we have attained has been incredibly hard fought and that progress is still being made despite all of our ongoing struggles that said it is important to recognize that several of the rights that our society has worked to normalize and protect are in fact being undermined often against the will of the public and for purely cynical political reasons and it is because of this because the ground beneath our feet is ever shifting in these hyper partisan times that it is vital that our elected leaders come together to pass senate resolution that would remove colorado same sex marriage ban from our state constitution for many it will likely come as surprise to learn that colorado has constitutionally enshrined same sex marriage ban after all same sex marriages have been legal in colorado and the rest of the s since 2015 when the s supreme court ruled on obergefell hodges the landmark obergefell decision legalized same sex marriages and made colorado 2006 ban unenforceable in perfect world obergefell would have put an end to this conversation the long overdue ruling ushered in normalization of same sex marriages and lgbtq rights generally speaking and at least in places like colorado but the fact of the matter is that same sex unions are not enshrined in the s constitution the only thing keeping them legal is the supreme court ruling which rests on an interpretation of the 14th amendment the very amendment that the court reinterpreted in 2022 to overturn roe wade worse still in that controversial ruling the court most radical justice clarence thomas laid out in his opinion vision of an america with no right to contraception same sex intimacy or same sex marriage while no one else signed onto thomas egregious treatise in post roe world it is not hard to imagine more constitutional rights toppling this brings us back to colorado same sex marriage ban if obergefell were to be overruled our ban could once again become law it is worth noting that many lgbtq rights are under attack or have simply never been granted in the first place we still have long way to go in our aspirational quest for freedom and justice for all this may seem absurd but we only have to look to arizona where that state supreme court upheld near total abortion ban from 1864 to see how real this possibility is the 1864 law had long and complicated history but it had become unenforceable after roe was ruled on in 1973 it was brought back from the dead with 2022 dobbs jackson these sorts of laws are rightfully known as zombie laws laws that are dead and forgotten until they aren despite an overwhelming public outcry about century old reproductive health law suddenly being back in effect arizona conservative lawmakers hemmed and hawed about whether or not to let it stand eventually after weeks of trying democrats were able to pass state senate bill to erase the measure with the help of just two of their republican counterparts this is where things get tricky for colorado to remove something from the colorado constitution takes two thirds majority in both the house and senate in the house colorado democrats have the votes necessary but in the senate they will need at least one vote from republican of course we want to be optimistic we want to imagine that it will be easy for this senate resolution to sweep through the capitol in fact we wish for nothing more than total support from all members of the house and the senate but in the wake of the recent debacle with an effort to amend our state constitution to remove the statute of limitations on cases of child sexual abuse we aren nearly as confident as we like to be instead of passing simple piece of legislation that would help hold those who are guilty of child sexual abuse accountable for their detestable actions colorado republicans voted along the party line and killed the resolution in statement senate republican leaders defended their indefensible position by saying the resolution would have upended numerous constitutional and legally settled rights we all depend on such cynical politics is exactly why we have our doubts and why it is so important to pass this senate resolution to get this same sex marriage ban out of our constitution we hope republicans prove us wrong and help this resolution pass all of this may seem convoluted like string of scenarios riddled with what ifs what if the s supreme court continues its rightward shift what if it overturns obergefell what if our same sex ban becomes zombie law what if it is enforced if these hypotheticals aren convincing consider this our state constitution is living breathing document it was by its very nature meant to be amended meant to grow and progress as our society grew and progressed america founders and colorado first leaders did not profess to know everything that is the whole point of an amendment because we are always growing and learning and adapting our constitution is reflection of who we are it is reflection of our values no matter what happens at the s supreme court banning same sex marriage is not who we are at least not anymore human progress is neither automatic nor inevitable martin luther king jr said in 1959 every step toward the goal of justice requires sacrifice suffering and struggle the tireless exertions and passionate concern of dedicated individuals let honor all the tireless exertion that has gotten us this far and get our lawmakers to pass this resolution so that in november we can come together and remove this outdated provision from our constitution and take another step toward living our values gary garrison for the editorial board,['anonymous'],99

chicago tribune on how even high flying starbucks is suffering the s consumer is increasingly tapped out and the effects are being felt in even the strongest most resilient brands out there exhibit is starbucks the seattle based coffee chain ubiquitous in the s and increasingly truly global franchise on wednesday laid one of the biggest eggs it ever has on wall street with first quarter earnings report that sent many investors running for the exits like their caramel frappuccinos were on fire the stock closed down nearly 16 on more than eight times the average trading volume we could bore you with the numbers but suffice to say there was investor shock over brand that has known decades of robust growth reporting 4 year over year decline in same store sales the obvious concern have s consumers not to mention those in china and other countries finally hit limit on how much they will pay for cup of coffee starbucks has defied this concern for decades deftly pitching its offerings as premium experiences even as the company footprint expanded relentlessly into what now seems like every hamlet or street corner in the country in some cities it feels like even the starbucks have starbucks can product be considered special when it available everywhere that question was particularly front of mind wednesday when company executives pinned good part of their first quarter woes on occasional customers making starbucks visit much rarer occurrence than had been the case before the hardcore starbucks loyalist remains steadfast they said trying to reassure fretful analysts the problem everyone else occasional customers ceo laxman narasimhan told analysts are clearly making choices based on the economic pressures they face to be clear starbucks isn the only fast food or convenience brand whipsawed by sour consumer sentiment yum brands kfc and pizza hut brands reported same store sales declines of 7 and 6 respectively in the s mcdonald the 800 pound gorilla of the sector managed 2 same store sales growth in the quarter but its executives told analysts they were surprised by how quickly consumers in the s and in other countries have tightened their belts in 2024 one can discern quite bit from the fast food and convenience dining sectors in terms of the state of the economy and even politics last year the economic narrative focused on the remarkably resilient s consumer still cheerily spending away despite inflationary pressures and relatively high interest rates central bankers were getting preliminary plaudits for battling inflation to standstill through higher rates without suffering the corresponding recession we usually do in such campaigns now the consumer is fraught the biden administration economic bragging points are undermined and presidential election is approaching amid broad public unhappiness with their electoral choices and the state of the country in the past when consumers got nervous about the economy and their household budgets mcdonald and other fast food purveyors would thrive after all those options were affordable alternatives to pricier restaurant downtown or even neighborhood diner we appear to be seeing something new in this version of economic angst cost pressures including the minimum wage requirements imposed by huge states like california and here in chicago as well have driven up the price of fast food meals to point where people are shocked at the counter wait tall meaning small in starbucks ese pike costs what again the value options are few and far between at chains of all kinds there little appeal in joining the sandwich shop rewards club forcing you to provide the company your email and other useful private information and getting tenth sandwich free after buying nine meals at painfully steep prices arguably no chain has proven more impregnable to this dynamic than starbucks but the coffee giant at long last may have hit wall there are locally owned coffee specialists and cheaper dunkin donuts virtually everywhere from city neighborhoods to small towns giving consumers truly singular experience those are starbucks competition and when starbucks prices essentially are the same as or even higher than the boutique neighborhood roaster despite the massive economies of scale advantages starbucks enjoys it prompts head scratching could ceiling on tall coffee of the day or monthly specials like two lattes for the price of one be coming soon to starbucks near you the seattle brain trust reassured analysts such an approach is furthest from their minds another few quarters like the first may soften their resolve we ll see mcdonald may have some tips to offer their rivals in seattle having gone through more than few of these cycles in which the golden arches prices products

wave of protests expressing solidarity with the palestinian people is spreading across college and university campuses there were more than 400 such demonstrations by the end of april 2024 just in the s with many more in canada and other countries the specific demands vary from place to place what unites them is call for schools to use their financial leverage and other kinds of influence to apply pressure on israel the protesters are demanding divestment meaning the sale of financial assets either related to israeli companies or shares in other corporations perceived to assist the israeli military in addition many protests include calls for the disclosure of those financial ties they also feature demands for colleges and universities to distance themselves from israel by ending study abroad programs and academic exchanges the demands are mostly response to israel bombings and other military operations in gaza that followed the oct 7 2024 hamas attack on israel they also stem from broader concerns around israel long running blockade of gaza and half century of military occupation of the west bank and gaza both of those concerns have been behind the boycott divestment and sanctions movement for nearly 20 years have spent decades teaching and researching israeli palestinian relations and the global politics surrounding these issues along the way ve learned that the discourse around the activism related to this middle eastern conflict is at least as relevant as the direct effects of the activism itself bds tactics in 2005 170 palestinian civil society groups came together to initiate call for boycott divestment and sanctions many student organizations academic associations and other kinds of groups later embraced the initiative bds activists call for consumers around the world to boycott israeli made goods and refrain from spending money on israeli movies music and other cultural products they discourage non israeli bands from performing in israel and urge scholars and students not to study at or engage with israeli academic institutions the movement also promotes divestment from holdings that support israel military operations and it seeks to impose sanctions which could hypothetically include arms embargoes asset freezes or trade barriers in other words the s government would have to participate for sanctions to work due to its close ties with the israeli government this is extremely unlikely nevertheless the s has recently sanctioned certain far right israeli entities s based bds activists have for this reason focused on boycott and divestment rather than sanctions bds goals along with those tactics bds has three goals or pillars the first is ending israel occupation of the west bank and gaza the second is dismantling the separation wall snaking through the west bank the third is attaining full equality for palestinian citizens of israel and the right of palestinian refugees to return to their ancestral towns and villages in historic palestine about 750 000 palestinians fled or were forced to move to surrounding areas prior to and during the 1948 arab israeli war two thirds of gaza current residents are refugees and their descendants who were uprooted from their homes in 1948 this right to return is enshrined in international law while israel has never let these palestinian refugees return it does maintain law of return for jews response to bds bds has caught on with many palestinians and their supporters across the globe but there been concerted effort in israel and the s to legislate against it israel has barred some bds supporters with jews among them from entering the country and 38 s states as of 2024 have enacted anti bds legislation such laws require state contractors to pledge that they will not engage in bds or they require states to not invest funds in companies that support the movement goals to some jews boycotting israeli products evokes the nazi boycott of jewish businesses in germany in the 1930s other critics believe academic and cultural ties should never be restricted for any reason there are also bds critics who find the tactics legitimate but object to one or more of the movement goals the least controversial goal of the three pillars is full equality for palestinian citizens of israel bds critics almost never object to this goal instead the debate occurs over the degree to which different people view palestinian citizens of israel as already possessing equality the second goal ending israel occupation tends to be opposed primarily by right wing supporters of israel these more conservative israel supporters either believe that the occupation including the security barrier that separates palestinian residents of the west bank from israeli settlers and from israeli residents in noncontested areas is necessary for maintaining israeli security or that there is no occupation at all other israelis say that israeli settlers deserve to live in all the lands of ancient israel including the west bank granting all palestinian refugees the right to return is the most controversial bds goal because of fears that jews would perhaps become minority of israel citizens causing the country to cease to be jewish state people with those concerns say making jews minority in israel would be unjust and perhaps even an expression of antisemitism another common concern regarding the bds movement and the slightly different demands heard on campuses today has to do with the impression that israel is being singled out for criticism when there are many other countries that commit human rights violations modest success stories the protests on college campuses in the spring of 2024 including those with prolonged encampments have had at best modest success for example brown university protesters managed to persuade the administration to hold vote on divesting from companies connected to the israeli military in return the protesters agreed to dismantle their encampment portland state university administrators agreed to pause its relationship with boeing which is military contractor as well as civilian aircraft manufacturer perhaps most importantly though the protests have helped place palestinian human rights demands squarely in the public eye mira sucharov is professor of political science at carleton university this article is

44,c8b8dbd971a081283f468949c7556da8,Thomas Friedman: Israel and Saudi Arabia are trading places,https://www.twincities.com/2024/05/05/thomas-friedman-israel-and-saudi-arabia-are-trading-places/,twincities,,riyadh saudi arabia saudi arabia and israel are america two most important middle east allies and the biden administration is deeply involved with both today trying to forge mutual defense treaty with saudi arabia and help israel in its conflicts with hamas and iran but the biden team has run into an unprecedented situation with these two longtime partners that is creating huge opportunity and huge danger for america it derives from the contrast in their internal politics to put it bluntly saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman has put his country worst religious extremists in jail while israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu has put his country worst religious extremists in his cabinet and therein lies tale mbs with his laser focus on economic growth after several decades that he has described saudi arabia as having been sleeping has unleashed the most important social revolution ever in the desert kingdom and one that is sending shock waves around the arab world it has reached point where the s and saudi arabia are now putting the finishing touches on formal alliance that could isolate iran curb china influence in the middle east and peacefully inspire more positive change in this region than the s invasions of iraq and afghanistan ever did militarily mbs government did something appalling when it killed saudi journalist jamal khashoggi liberal critic living in the united states in istanbul in 2018 mbs has also done something none of his predecessors dared break the stranglehold that the most conservative islamists held over saudi social and religious policy since 1979 this shift has proved so popular among so many saudi women and young people that women participation in the workforce jumped to 35 from 20 between 2018 and 2022 according to report by the atlantic council and is even higher today that is one of the most rapid social changes anywhere in the world in riyadh you see its impact on the city streets in its coffeehouses and in government and business offices saudi women aren just driving cars they are driving change in the diplomatic corps in the biggest banks and in the recent saudi women premier soccer league mbs radical new vision for his country is nowhere more manifest than in his publicly stated willingness to normalize diplomatic and economic relations with the jewish state as part of new mutual defense pact with the united states the crown prince wants as peaceful region as possible and saudi arabia as secure from iran as possible so he can focus on making saudi arabia diversified economic powerhouse that used to be israel too alas the tragedy of israel under netanyahu is that because he has been so desperate to gain and hold power to avoid possible jail time on corruption charges he has created governing coalition that has given unprecedented power to two far right jewish supremacists with authority in three ministries defense finance and national security and prioritized judicial coup before it did anything else netanyahu has also made unparalleled concessions to ultra orthodox rabbis transferring enormous sums of money to their schools that often don teach math english or civics and most of whose draft age men refuse to serve in the army at all let alone alongside women of course saudi arabia is an absolute monarchy and israel is democracy mbs can order changes that no israeli prime minister can still leaders in both have to gauge what will enable them to stay in power and those instincts are driving netanyahu to make israel more like the worst of the old saudi arabia and mbs to make saudi arabia more like the best of the old israel the result of netanyahu alliance with the far right is that israel can take advantage of the tectonic shift in saudi arabia with its offer to normalize relations with the jewish state and open road for israel with the rest of the muslim world because doing so would require israel to pursue pathway with palestinians to create two states for two indigenous peoples moreover without offering some horizon for two state solution with non hamas palestinians israel can forge permanent security alliance with the coalition of moderate arab states that helped thwart the barrage of more than 300 drones and missiles that iran fired at israel on april 13 in response to israel killing of senior iranian military commander and some of his subordinates in syria those arab states cannot afford to appear to be defending israel indefinitely if israel is not working to find moderate palestinian partners to replace israel control over the gaza strip and the west bank in other words israel today cannot summon the coalitions it needs to thrive as nation because it would lead to the breakup of the governing coalition that netanyahu needs to survive as politician all of this is creating huge headache for president joe biden who has done more to save the israeli people from hamas and iran than any other american president but has been frustrated by an israeli prime minister who is more interested in saving himself biden support for netanyahu is now costing him politically and curtailing his ability to take full advantage of the changes in the arabian peninsula it could also cost him reelection since mbs began dominating saudi decision making in 2016 in the place of his ailing father king salman saudi arabia has basically gone from an incubator of aq al qaida to an incubator of ai indeed there is lot of trouble these days between the two most reform minded leaders in the arab world mbs and mbz mohammed bin zayed the ruler of the united arab emirates but it is good trouble it is an intense competition over who can partner fastest and deepest with the most important global companies driving artificial intelligence as the uae most important newspaper the national noted tuesday in the aftermath of microsoft 1 5 billion investment in abu dhabi artificial intelligence and cloud company g42 the spotlight is now on the middle east growing stature as regional leader for global technology the charge led by the uae and saudi arabia has attracted attention from the likes of oracle google and amazon and highlights increasing investor confidence in the region with growing financial backing from and relations with the west it is impossible to overstate the power of nearby good example when mbs announced in 2018 that saudi women could attend sporting events like men soccer games iranian women demanded the same from their ayatollahs the ayatollahs were forced to relent after 29 year old iranian woman charged with trying to attend men soccer match died in september 2019 after setting herself on fire as one young saudi official recently remarked to me mbs was able to sideline the religious extremists in the kingdom without starting civil war by unleashing all the pent up energy of young saudis who wanted to realize their full potential by being connected with all the cutting edge global trends so these youths just steamrolled the resistance from the roughly 30 of saudis whom d describe as hyperconservative saudi sources tell me that about 500 of the most extreme clerics have been locked up mbs is wisely still paying other very conservative government religious officials like the religious police but he has disempowered them not without personal risk to himself iran by contrast has unleashed the full brutality of its religious authorities to steamroll iranian youths who went into open civil war with the regime in september 2022 after an iranian woman named mahsa amini died in police custody she had been arrested for allegedly not properly covering herself in public that is why you get scenes like iranian college students in 2020 refusing to walk on american and israeli flags that the clerics painted on the ground at the gateways to their universities or in april booing and honking horns at soccer match when the regime demanded moment of silence in honor of the iranian military commanders killed by israel they see iran religious dictators exploiting the palestinian cause and hamas to cover the iran revolutionary guard brutality against iran own youth this is in stark contrast with some of the s college students now demonstrating who see israel as the colonial aggressor and giving hamas free pass even though it murdered kidnapped and raped israelis oct 7 triggering the massive israeli bombardments that have killed tens of thousands of civilians in gaza including thousands of children with seeming indifference the key question for the biden administration and the saudis today is this what to do next the good news is that they are 90 done with the mutual defense treaty that they have drawn up both sides tell me but they still need to tie down few key points these include the precise ways in which the s will control the civilian nuclear energy program that saudi arabia will get under the deal whether the mutual defense component will be explicit like that between the s and japan or less formal like the understanding between the s and taiwan and long term commitment for saudi arabia to continue to price oil in s dollars not switch to the chinese currency but the other part of the deal which is seen as critical to winning support in congress is for saudi arabia to normalize relations with israel that will happen only if israel agrees to riyadh terms get out of gaza freeze the building of settlements in the west bank and embark on three to five year pathway to establish palestinian state in the occupied territories that state would also be conditioned on the palestinian authority undertaking reforms to make it governing body that palestinians trust and see as legitimate and israelis see as effective there are lot of ifs and provided thats in this equation that seem most unlikely today they might seem less so when the war in gaza ends and both israelis and palestinians add up the terrible costs of not having permanent peaceful solution and contemplate whether they want more of the same or to make radical departure it is clear to s and saudi officials that with netanyahu having thrown in with the far right to stay in power he highly unlikely to agree to any kind of palestinian statehood that would lead his partners to topple him unless his political survival dictates otherwise as result the s and the saudis are considering finalizing the deal and taking it to congress with the stated proviso that saudi arabia will normalize relations with israel the minute israel has government ready to meet the saudi s terms but no decision has been made s officials know that israel is in such turmoil today and with the whole world seemingly coming down on it it is impossible to really get israelis to consider the profound long term political and economic benefits of normalized relations with saudi arabia the world most influential muslim nation and arab nation hopefully though if there can be permanent end of fighting and return of all israelis taken hostage israel will hold new elections and then maybe just maybe the choice on the table for israelis will not be bibi or bibi lite but bibi or credible pathway to peace with saudi arabia and the palestinians

less than 100 days one small corner of the french capital is preparing for another modern form of competition based in antiquity christie auction of early christian texts from north africa some of the most important religious artifacts to come up for sale in recent years the manuscripts from the privately owned schoyen collection including the oldest complete version of the first epistle of peter and the book of jonah were displayed in new york earlier this month and have arrived in paris for inspection by prospective bidders the auction sale of the works written on papyrus in the coptic language will take place at christie in london in june the viewings of the schoyen collection have drawn representatives from museums around the world as well as private collectors to some they represent beauty to others links to the past and to others connection with faith this is one of the most important sales christie has ever held in this field said eugenio donadoni senior specialist in medieval and renaissance manuscripts at christie they are touchstones helping us understand the history of christianity the schoyen collection is the work of martin schoyen building on the collections of his father and now comprises 20 000 manuscripts including 400 linked to the bible now in his 80s schoyen has decided to sell part of it including the most important artifacts according to donadoni the crosby schoyen codex valued at about 3 7 million is thought to be the world oldest book in private hands comprising besides peter epistle and the story of jonah part of the book of maccabees and an easter homily it is highly significant in the history of writing said donadoni because it marks pivotal moment it is the transition from scrolls to codicils as christianity spreads across the mediterranean but the codex also shows the religious pivot going on at the time it is thought that the codex was used by monastery in upper egypt around the middle of the third century before the council of nicaea in 325 which tried to secure consensus on issues of christian belief such as the relationship between god the father and god the son and the latter divine nature you can see from the codex that they are finding their feet as christians said donadoni they are still steeped in jewish tradition and are shaping the new religion the book is so old that it calls the text now known as the first epistle of peter the letter of peter as if they are not aware that further letter exists another major manuscript going up for sale on june 11 is the codex sinaiticus rescriptus which is in effect an ancient effort at recycling in the 10th century john zosimos monk at monastery near jerusalem acquired document written on expensive vellum which he packed up and took to st catherine monastery in the sinai desert to reuse for his own writing the original writing itself the earliest surviving piece of the gospels to be written in aramaic dating from the fifth or sixth century is still visible the codex sinaiticus rescriptus christie images ltd 2024 the underlying text was not scrubbed out very well so under fluorescent lighting you can still see it written in the language that jesus himself would have spoken said donadoni the document valued 1 85 million is bargain as the buyer gets the two texts for the price of one also part of the schoyen collection is the holkham hebrew bible sephardic manuscript in hebrew from the 13th century the geraardsbergen bible from late 12th century flanders and commentary on the gospels by the venerable bede from the 11th century last year the codex sassoon hebrew bible more than 1 000 years old became the most valuable manuscript sold at auction when it went for 38 1 million at sotheby in new york confirming new york as the leading market for hebraic religious texts while london remains the capital for sales of illuminated christian texts but both centers attract buyers including museums from around the world prices are believed to have been pushed higher by the intervention of one major player the green family s evangelical christians who have used their fortune created by the hobby lobby chain of craft stores to purchase illuminated or decorated manuscripts torahs papyri and other works worth 20 million to 40 million from auction houses dealers private collectors and institutions items from the green collection were donated to the museum of the bible in washington family project that opened in 2017 with mission to inspire confidence in the absolute authority and reliability of the bible it has since stepped back from this evangelical purpose and says that it is an institution whose purpose is to invite all people to engage with the transformative power of the bible the chronique de la bouquechardiere christie images ltd 2024 meanwhile the faith and liberty discovery center bible museum created by the american bible society in philadelphia announced that it will shut its doors after fewer than three years of operation and an investment of 60 million opened in the wake of covid 19 pandemic lockdowns it failed to draw anywhere close to its projected 250 000 annual visitors the british and foreign bible society which has the biggest collection of bibles and other religious books and documents in the world has shied away from opening museum although it does open its collection based at cambridge university to scholars and researchers while it still expands through legacies and donations and is committed to good stewardship of its existing treasures the society does not acquire items with its own funds preferring it says to disseminate the bible and be involved in mission rather than convey the message that the bible is museum piece in recent times there have been concerns that some items held by biblical manuscript collectors have been acquired through the black market especially from people in trouble spots in the middle east according to christie donadoni all the items from the schoyen collection that are up for auction in june have had their provenance vetted and have been checked extensively by its legal department ,['anonymous'],99

they bring their new high holy day machzor to shul this autumn many reform congregants will feel the difference the book will be lighter than the previous edition not because it has has fewer pages in fact with 1 300 it has more but because it has reverted to two volume set rather than the single one published in 1985 the change in weight has one obvious practicality as the machzor editorial group chair rabbi mark goldsmith of edgware and hendon reform explained in so many synagogues you are not in your regular seat you are in seat in hall or cinema even as was finchley reform last year so you haven got place to lean your book against he said the machzor is available as an ebook too an option open to progressive movements but not to orthodox the advantage of an ebook version for those who need to use it is that they can make the font size whatever works for them which is not possible with hard print he said new machzor is usually once in generation event that reflects both changes that may have taken place in the intervening decades since the previous edition but also anticipation of what will continue to speak to readers in the years ahead the latest reform high holy day machzor the ninth in the movement 180 plus history has been designed to match its most recent siddur which reached congregations in 2008 it features clear layout and signposting use of colour illustrations gender neutral language for god and transliteration of hebrew prayers into english letters it took 10 years to produce it might have been eight were it not for covid rabbi goldsmith said rabbi mark goldsmith we felt that accessibility is hugely important he said rosh hashanah and yom kippur are days when many people will come to synagogue who don come regularly during the year and therefore knowing where you are what going on makes it more meaningful experience updating the language was essential too for 51 weeks of the year rabbis were referring to god as the eternal in the siddur but in the 1985 machzor god goes back to being he and the lord which jars with more and more people said the machzor co editor rabbi paul freedman of radlett reform in no prayer was this more apparent than one of the best known our father our king the new machzor includes four variations of the prayer including one that keeps the two hebrew terms but does not translate them and another than uses different names to address god while the machzor does not follow the siddur in offering alternative service tracks it does give options alongside prayers there are interpretations which give the opportunity to use study piece in place of prayer when you feel as prayer leader that going to be more relevant or meaningful at particular time rabbi goldsmith said we ve done it by colour coding which was not possible to do in previous years in 1985 not many reform synagogues would celebrate two days of rosh hashanah now almost all of them do and this book gives you choices to be able to do something different on second day rosh hashanah co editors of the new reform machzor rabbis paul freedman left and jonathan magonet the machzor contains over 1 000 study passages both alongside the prayers and in an anthology at the back much of which were compiled by the co editor rabbi professor jonathan magonet the former principal of leo baeck college co editor of the 1985 edition he must be one of the few people with the distinction of editing machzor twice one of the challenges rabbi goldsmith said was trying to figure out which issues today would remain so in 2065 and that is difficult one of jonathan and lionel blue achievements in the 1985 machzor was it never did feel out of date we re assuming ecology climate change is going to be an issue for many years ahead we re assuming that alienation through technology might be as well and we re assuming the relationship with israel will be in there as well there much more israeli poetry and israeli writers than there were in 1985 there is also significant increase in contributions by women one of his own favourites is piece by rabbi miriam berger of finchley reform which imagines if god were able to speak to us about the things that we would hope that god would have managed but doesn seem to have managed the study passages also help to anchor the theme of each service particularly on yom kippur so that as rabbi magonet explained you do have feeling that you are going on journey through the day and are not just stumbling from one amidah to the next one example of notable change comes in the avodah the central part of the yom kippur liturgy which recalls the priestly atonement rites in the temple the 1985 machzor was groundbreaking in the way it retold the drama of the high priest and the sacrificial rites in temples times rabbi freedman said it retold the drama but in an explanatory way not quite at arms length but asking questions about how it is relevant to us today rather than just removing it because in our liturgy we don pray for the restoration of the temple and animal sacrifices this section also records the martyrdom of the ten rabbis in roman times it has taken that essential idea still to continue with the ten rabbis who gave their lives in pursuit of holiness and teaching torah rabbi freedman said but an updated series of readings now invite reflection on how now shall we live our lives and approach god and bring god into the world one significant difference rabbi magonet pointed out was that the last book was still very much concerned about the shoah and the direct impact it had on our communities that was evident in the readings for the martyrdom section in 1985 material on the shoah is retained in the study anthology and in yizkor but for the central part of the day it was felt the machzor should be looking in different direction rabbi magonet said less at the tragedy of death and martyrology and more toward the sanctification of life and our place in the world the focus has moved somewhat he said the shoah memories in the old book have become now like the temple sacrifice material of the previous book we have moved on in certain way but we haven lost the past but we ve changed our perception of how it is to be used and understood in our contemporary world ,['anonymous'],99
49,9a02b702aa2fc6a5561b38c9bead94aa,Editorial: Brandon Johnson’s Bears stadium flub tells us much about his economic philosophy,https://www.chicagotribune.com/2024/05/05/editorial-bears-stadium-brandon-johnson-jb-pritzker/,chicagotribune,https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/CTC-L-bears-stadium-Johnson.jpg?w=1400px&strip=all,are professional sports stadiums cost effective drivers of economic growth mayor brandon johnson sure thinks so at least as it pertains to the chicago bears proposal for domed stadium on the city lakefront in cheerleading for the project which would couple about 2 billion in investment from the team with more than 1 billion in upfront taxpayer assistance far more over time as bonds floated to finance that amount are serviced johnson has touted 24 000 jobs for the city of chicago including 2 300 permanent ones so why have the flashy visuals of football palace accompanied by ballfields and other public amenities been met with overwhelming negativity not just from the governor and his senior staff but also state lawmakers lakefront protection advocates and even sports talk show radio hosts first of course there the distasteful optic of yet another uber wealthy sports franchise groveling for taxpayer subsidies but not to be overlooked is the skepticism over whether sports stadiums generally and this one in particular are economic game changers the revealing narrative driving report released nearly year ago by johnson allies titled first we get the money truly has turned out to be one of the few consistent philosophies johnson has followed in his chaotic first year his revenue raising efforts generally have sputtered most notably voters rejection of referendum to quadruple the tax on sales of residential and commercial property over 1 5 million in order to fund homelessness programs but he shows no signs of shifting course so given that chicago taxpayer rejection it surely was appealing to johnson that one of the benefits of the bears proposal was the dearth of city tax subsidies at least direct ones needed to make it happen the city would get the money not from its own taxpayers but from bonds floated by state agency likewise chicago government tills wouldn furnish the 1 2 billion needed for those playing fields and other amenities depicted in the beautiful renderings state and federal grants or other funding to be named later would cover the public benefits of course chicagoans also happen to be illinoisans and pay plenty of state taxes as well as local ones so ultimately they are on the hook for good chunk of this largesse but that wasn part of the johnson sales pitch as in other past situations confronting the city and state in the fall and winter the bears stadium plan has required gov b pritzker to overrule johnson in this case like parent at the grocery store telling their kid to put the candy back on the shelf pritzker administration officials merriam webster defines nonstarter as someone or something that is not productive or effective in essence the governor instructed the bears team and by proxy johnson since he is on board with this exact plan to try again with something completely different the bears aren politicians they have to win games not popularity contests for johnson on the other hand the public thumbs down to project he touted as transformational for the city of chicago marks another humiliating rebuke not only have illinois powers that be declared this plan dead on arrival portions of johnson progressive base have recoiled as well wondering why the mayor they thought was going to make the well to do pay more to finance benefits programs of all sorts now is beating the drum for taxpayer cash to make the wealthy nfl owners even wealthier the political fumbles we ve seen in the stadium rollout aren even what most disappointing to us the revelation unsurprising as it is of mayor who thinks thriving city economy relies on the public sector or in this case public private partnership to put it euphemistically to make multibillion dollar investments in return for few thousand permanent jobs if that even the correct number puts on display lack of understanding of what generates genuinely productive business activity tribune editorial cartoonist scott stantis on mayor brandon johnson backing the bears new stadium proposal scott stantis for the chicago tribune johnson has shown little interest with one notable exception in making chicago business environment more favorable for private sector investment that exception and the mayor deserves praise for it is an effort to cut city government red tape for housing developers chicago permitting system is byzantine and streamlining it is worthy goal other mayors have tried it and largely failed we re rooting for johnson to succeed where they didn but public works particularly those favoring well heeled business interests in no need of subsidy often aren a significant driver of economic growth to be sure some can be crucial linchpins for example transit stations are reliable hubs around which businesses and household formation can take root and expand but without additional private sector investment the stations are merely modest job generators this bears stadium strikes us as particularly costly version of that dynamic how will massive replacement structure set apart on parkland on which no one else can build and removed from the rest of the city by dusable lake shore drive promote economic growth beyond its operation and no we re not counting super bowl coming once every two or three decades numerous studies have demonstrated that massive public investments in professional sports stadiums don yield commensurate benefits that what pritzker business owner before he became politician understands in way that johnson clearly does not thankfully for all illinois taxpayers pritzker will require any team stadium plan relying on public cash whether that notion comes from the bears or the white sox or the red stars or whomever to demonstrate public benefit to the investment being made given the likelihood of cost overruns and future negative tax surprises the standard really ought to be an independently appraised public and economic benefit than what taxpayers provide since the mayor already is on board with this doa plan he unlikely to be major part of any real future stadium deal cutting he be better served developing more initiatives to make chicago an easier city in which to do business create well paying jobs and attract visitors and diverse talented young graduates that by far the best way to get the money ,['theeditorialboard'],99
