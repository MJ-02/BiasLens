Visitation will be held from 4-6PM on Sunday, April 28, 2024 at Bayview Freeborn Funeral Home and for an hour prior to the service. Burial will be held at Hayward Cemetery following the service. Pastor Shane Koepke will be officiating. Marvel Dockwell Marvel was born June 11, 1933 to Adolph and Frieda (Yost) Johnson in Albert Lea. She attended Emmons High School and after graduating, began her career working at the Montgomery ward. She was married to Vernon Dockwell on June 19, 1955 at Trinity Lutheran church. Together they had Robert, Debra, Brian, and Robin. After Vernon passed away on January 25, 1975, Marvel took up the challenge of raising her children alone, demonstrating tremendous strength and resilience. She began working at the Albert Lea Tribune for a while before changing to work at Fleetguard until her retirement. Marvel loved babysitting her grandkids, often joking with them about her puffy knees and telling them stories of her growing up. Although she loved cooking and baking, every meal she served her grandkids was Schwan’s or TV dinners. She was never afraid to speak her mind and had a stubborn streak a mile long. She is preceded in death by her husband Vernon, parents Adolph and Frieda, sister Delores Twito, and her son Robert. She is survived by her daughter Debra (Jerry) Sipple, son Brian (Jonna) Dockwell, daughter Robin (Greg) Witham, grandchildren Kevin Witham, Stephanie Myers, Brandy Dockwell, Daniel Dockwell, Crystal Dockwell, Allen Dockwell, Zac (Brittany) Oquist, Tessa (Shannon) Mclean, Shelby (Antonio) Lugo, Ben (Kelsey) Witham, Joey (Kylie) Witham, Sam (Abby) Witham, great grandchildren Kaden (Annie) Sipple, Kyler (Raine) Sipple, Taylor Sipple, Aida Dockwell, Yeilen Lugo, Vienna Lugo, Makael Lugo, Rylan Oquist, Luella Oquist and Braxton Oquist; and several nieces and nephews.',\n",

There will be a military send off on May 1, 2024 at 10:00 am at Bayview Funeral Home in Albert Lea, MN, with following a private burial immediately following afterwards. Tom was born on September 20, 1943 to T. Floyd and Selma Hughes in Albert Lea, MN. Tom graduated from Alden High School in 1961. After graduating from high school he joined the Army, serving in the Vietnam War. After his discharge, he went to college for accounting, landing a job in the Twin Cities Area where he resided and worked until the age of 62, when he retired and moved back to Alden at the home place where he was raised. When Tom moved back to Alden, MN, he took on the responsibility of caring for his mother and he would visit her on a daily basis at St. John’s Lutheran Home. He took great joy with her company. He also was extremely proud of his Welsh heritage sharing that his family are buried at the Cambria Township Cemetery, in Blue Earth County and he will be the last one to join the family. Last September 4, 2024 when he turned 80 yrs. of age, he was in shock that he lived that long. He had been residing at St. John’s Woodlands Campus this past year so everyone sang and had cupcakes for his big day. It made his day and put a big smile on his face! Thank you to all the staff at St. John’s and St. Croix hospice for the great care you gave Tom. Tom is preceded in death by his parents T. Floyd and Selma Hughes, sister Alice Hughes, and his grandparents.',\n",

       "  'content': \"SOUTH LAKE TAHOE, Calif. – City Council halted an item establishing a local minimum wage ordinance and potentially increasing the minimum wage in the City of South Lake Tahoe. Councilmember Tamara Wallace made a motion directing the city manager to take no action establishing a local minimum wage, seconded by Councilmember Cristi Creegan. The motion passed 3-1 with both Wallace and Creegan, along with Mayor Cody Bass, voting yes. Councilmember Scott Robbins voted no. Robbins initially requested an item to discuss increasing the minimum wage in the City at a meeting in June, which was seconded by then Councilmember John Friedrich. Now Mayor Pro Tem, Friedrich was absent at Tuesday night’s meeting due to a family emergency. For that reason, Robbins requested Council continue the item to a future meeting, which was met with dissatisfaction from the crowd. Robbin’s motion to postpone did not receive a second and proceedings on the item continued that night. Numerous business owners and community members provided comment, lasting almost two hours. Immediately following the comments, Wallace made her motion. But prior to voting, Bass provided clarification that a $23 minimum wage amount was never brought forward by Council. Robbins had proposed a $23 amount in an opinion letter to the Tribune in August as well as social media posts. “I think it’s unfortunate that one councilmember does decide to put out their own opinions,” Mayor Bass said, “When we are in the process of deliberating these things because the point is for us to come in as a council of five to deliberate to find out what those rates would be.” Robbins said in discussion that he didn’t fail to hear the business owners who did come forward, but wanted to clarify some points, reading from President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s statement upon signing the first minimum wage in 1933: “‘It seems to me to be equally plain that no business which depends for existence on paying less than living wages to its workers has any right to continue in this country. By “business” I mean the whole of commerce as well as the whole of industry; by workers I mean all workers, the white collar class as well as the men in overalls; and by living wages I mean more than a bare subsistence level-I mean the wages of decent living.'” Robbins went on to say that the purpose of a minimum wage is to ensure someone working full-time can afford a humane existence and that $16 an hour is not a living wage in South Lake Tahoe, listing rental prices in the area. Wallace responded, stating the minimum wage versus living wage definition has changed in the last 90 years. “[The] minimum wage definition is: protect workers against unduly low wages,” she said and continued, “The living wage is a wage high enough to maintain a normal standard of living,” adding, the minimum wage was not supposed to support a family of four or even a family. “It’s a minimum wage for someone entering the job market.” Wallace went on to say, “It is very discouraging to me that someone who has publicly stated that he wants to lower tourism by at least 10% and destroy those businesses, to then require those same businesses that are supported by tourism to have them mandatorily increase the pay to those employees that they employ by 43.75%.” Robbins quickly responded, “Over five years.” “It’s still an increase of 43.75% while you’re wanting them to reduce their business by 10%,” she responded, “so, let’s vote.” Robbins later provided a statement to the Tribune concerning the 10% remark. “That has been, purposely, taken wildly out of context,” he said and explains he was speaking about the peak Fourth of July crowds, “like what lead to the beach trashing last summer.” The Tribune will provide a more in-depth look at the comments shared that night in a future article.\",\n",

Sources claim that the father of two is now looking into appearing via video link or a pre-recorded message instead. “Whenever Harry travels to the UK, his trips are always dependent on how secure he is,” a source told the Express . “Before deciding whether to attend the Invictus Games anniversary event, his security team must be sure that St. Paul’s is adequately protected by the metropolitan police and his own security needs are met while he’s in London.” “Harry wants to spend more time in the UK with his family, but there’s no way he can do that while a question mark hangs over his security detail,” the Duke added. The insider added that Harry was left “extremely disappointed” over his security in the UK — or lack thereof. The Post has reached out to Harry’s reps for comment. While Harry’s rumored trip is still unconfirmed, it’s believed that celebrations will take place at St. Paul’s Cathedral. It’s unclear if the trip will be yet another solo venture, following hot on the heels of his 24-hour dash in February . That month, Harry and his wife, Meghan Markle, 42, were stripped of funded police protection after they stepped back from being “working royals” and moved to the US in 2020. This means that the Sussexes will now have to pay out of pocket for their security when traveling across the pond. Harry’s lawyers had sought a judicial review of the government’s refusal of his offer to hire police officers as his private security detail, which was initially denied by London’s High Court in May 2023. And earlier this month, Harry lost his bid to appeal London High Court’s ruling in a final blow to his case. What’s more, he was ordered to pay 90% of the UK Home Office’s legal costs for defending the court’s initial ruling.',\n",

       "  'content': \"England's 50-over World Cup title defence in India last autumn was an unmitigated disaster. Just three wins in nine games, two of which came after they had been eliminated. But now they get a do-over, of sorts. Jos Buttler's side will be out to defend their T20 World Cup title in the West Indies in June, live on Sky Sports , having won that tournament in Australia in late 2022. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Ben Stokes was the key man in a jittery run chase against Pakistan in the final at the MCG two years ago but will not be part of the 2024 tournament after making himself unavailable for selection. So, who will make England's provisional 15-man squad, which is due to be named next week ahead of a May 1 deadline? We look at those secure of their places, plus those still hoping and dreaming... There seems little doubt that Buttler and Phil Salt will open the batting for England. The skipper was always going to do that and looks in fine nick at the moment after two hundreds in three innings for Rajasthan Royals in the IPL, while Salt sealed his spot on the tour of the Caribbean in December with back-to-back centuries, cracking a combined 19 sixes across those two innings. England grouped with Australia at T20 World Cup T20 World Cup: Full fixtures and schedule How did teams qualify for T20 World Cup? T20 World Cup: Latest headlines Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Salt's inclusion also gives Buttler the option of captaining from mid-off and handing his opening partner the wicketkeeping gloves instead - or perhaps Jonny Bairstow, if the latter makes the cut. Harry Brook looks a lock in the middle order, while spin-bowling all-rounders Liam Livingstone and Moeen Ali seem certain of a place in the squad if not the 11. It could be Moeen's last hurrah in international cricket as he turns 37 midway through the tournament. Moeen's long-time spin-bowling partner Adil Rashid is arguably England's most important player. The leggie rose to the top of the T20I rankings for the first time in his career during the series against West Indies late last year, going at just 6.20 an over while other bowlers were battered for sixes. Seam-bowling-wise, Jofra Archer is expected to be named in England's initial squad as he continues his comeback from a raft of injuries, while fellow speedster Mark Wood should join him. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player We can probably also ink in all-rounder Sam Curran , Player of the Tournament at the last T20 World Cup. The left-arm seamer had a shocker of a 50-over World Cup last year but is enjoying a decent IPL with the ball for Punjab Kings, while he began that competition with a half-century. Curran's Kings team-mate Bairstow is not enjoying a decent IPL. He was dropped by his franchise after averaging just 16 across his first six innings, carrying over his lean run of form from England's 4-1 Test series defeat in India earlier this year in which he failed to reach 40 in 10 knocks. England are loyal to players but can also be ruthless, as Jason Roy has found out ahead of the previous two World Cups. Bairstow - a key cog in his country's white-ball rise post-2015 - may now be sweating on his place, even though he still seems likely to be in the top four. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Will Jacks appears odds-on to join him, with his hard-hitting batting - he crunched a 41-ball hundred in the SA20 earlier this year - and off-spin bowling making him an attractive pick. Test opener Ben Duckett is also eyeing a T20 middle-order slot and with Stokes absent and Dawid Malan's international career looking over, he would offer a valuable left-handed option. Surrey all-rounder Jamie Overton was viewed as a late bolter for the squad after an impressive run in franchise cricket around the world, including in last summer's Hundred when he thumped over 200 runs at a strike-rate of 181.98 for Manchester Originals. But the 30-year-old has now tweaked his back and been urged to rest for a couple of weeks before undergoing further tests. A T20 debut may have to wait. Leg-spinner Rehan Ahmed and left-arm spinner Tom Hartley could be vying for the final slow-bowling spot, while the other seamers in the running are Reece Topley , Tymal Mills , Chris Woakes and Gus Atkinson . Topley has arguably been England's best white-ball bowler over the last few years when fit, Woakes has oodles of experience, Mills can mix extreme pace with canny slower deliveries, and Atkinson looks the long-term successor to fellow quick Wood in all formats. It would be a surprise if anyone outside the players already mentioned gate-crashed the squad with Joe Root - for all of his reverse scoops - now seen as solely a Test and ODI player; England having moved on from the ageing Malan ; and Zak Crawley's path to a batting spot blocked by others. Left-arm quick Luke Wood and right-arm fast bowlers Brydon Carse and Richard Gleeson will probably need injuries to others - and lots of them - to be involved in the World Cup.

       "  'description': 'The reporter who dug up the dirt, the museum head who took the heat and the community forever changed by the ruby slipper theft.',\n",
       "  'content': 'Minnesota\\'s heist of the century occurred in an unlikely place: the modest Judy Garland Museum in Grand Rapids. Sometime after the museum closed on Aug. 27, 2005, a window was smashed and a pair of Dorothy\\'s ruby slippers from \"The Wizard of Oz\" vanished as mysteriously as the melted Wicked Witch. The sequin-studded shoes are no mere movie prop. They are, arguably, Hollywood\\'s most iconic memorabilia. And the theft of the cultural treasure — the emblem of one of the country\\'s most-watched films , referred to as America\\'s \"Mona Lisa\" — shone an unflattering spotlight on Garland\\'s humble hometown. Museum security had been lax. In the absence of security footage, fingers were pointed and accusations flew. National media likened local police to bumbling Keystone Kops. Divers plunged into an abandoned mine pit in search of the slippers. Not since the James-Younger gang rode into Northfield has a Minnesota town been so rocked by a theft. Left in the slippers\\' shimmering wake were lives complicated, relationships strained and reputations tarnished. Including that of the town itself, which had been unknowingly harboring a career criminal the Coen brothers couldn\\'t have scripted, one who thought the shoes were made of real rubies. \"It seemed everyone, including the PD, was baffled by what appeared to be a very easy lift,\" recalled Britta Arendt, who edited the local newspaper at that time. Then, 13 yearsafter the slippers disappeared, they returned out of nowhere, as if they\\'d simply clicked their magical heels instead of having been nabbed in an FBI sting. It took another five years for a local septuagenarian, Terry Jon Martin, to be indicted and plead guilty , in October 2023. But the case is far from settled. In fact, there\\'s still enough intrigue to bring a Los Angeles–based documentary crew to town to interview those impacted by the theft (for better or worse), including the reporter who dug up the dirt, the museum head who took the heat, the chief of police and various townsfolk. Whether locals consider the case with excitement or chagrin, many agree their community has forever changed, no longer likely to be mistaken for its better-known Michigan twin. \"Grand Rapids is going to be on the map forever,\" said Lilah Crowe, director of the Itasca County Historical Society . The reporter While many Minnesotans assume the slipper case closed, Pam Dowell knows the story is more complex, with as many twists and turns as Oz\\'s yellow brick road. Dowell, a feisty freelance reporter in the North Woods community of about 11,200, so identifies with her hometown that she sleeps under deer-print bedsheets and her email handle is \"GRPam.\" With her blond coiffure and spunky banter, Dowell evokes a Midwestern version of Angela Lansbury\\'s amateur detective on \"Murder She Wrote.\" She\\'s among the few in town to benefit from the theft\\'s glittering fallout after she got caught up in the caper last year. After Martin was charged in May, Dowell researched his troubled back story (his infant twins died in a car accident), criminal history (convictions for burglary, aggravated assault, robbery and receiving stolen goods) and associates (some of whom were involved in \"a sophisticated fencing ring,\" according to a 1988 Star Tribune article). Dowell wrote a series on the slipper theft for the local paper, then sent what she\\'d discovered to reporters and law enforcement agents she hoped might connect others to the crime. In January, the ailing thief, connected to an oxygen tank, was wheeled into the Duluth federal courthouse for sentencing . Outside, Dowell peppered Martin\\'s defense attorney with questions, including the brand of his buffalo-plaid coat and his client\\'s connections to organized crime. Martin, who lives in a trailer outside Grand Rapids, told authorities that a former mob associate coaxed him to commit \"one last score.\" So he smashed into the museum with a sledgehammer and stole the slippers. It wasn\\'t until he gave them to a jewelry fence that he learned the shoes weren\\'t made of actual rubies. He didn\\'t know what happened to them after that. That limited explanation doesn\\'t satisfy Dowell. She believes a network of criminals was involved and hopes the FBI will soon pull back the curtain. \"Who is the great and powerful Oz in this heist, and how many more characters are part of this story?\" she asked her thousands of Facebook followers . Dowell keeps trying to piece the puzzle together. Recently, a serendipitous grocery store run ended in another tip, which she passed on to law enforcement. (One cop nicknamed her \"the oil well,\" for digging deep.) What authorities have made public about the theft, Dowell explained, is just its black-and-white outline. The full, technicolor tale may have ties to 1) a prominent Minneapolis criminal defense attorney 2) a famous Minnesota comic\\'s brother 3) a cache of Norman Rockwell paintings stolen from a St. Louis Park gallery. (See reporting in the Washington Post , the podcast, \" No Place Like Home \" and books \" Under the Rainbow \" and \" The Rockwell Heist \" for details.) Sleuthing energizes Dowell. As does the attention from the documentary filmmakers, who have her serving as a sort of tour guide/fixer/narrator. The whole slipper situation \"really gave me a bounce,\" Dowell said. The museum director If the theft buoyed Dowell, it sank John Kelsch, who led the Judy Garland museum for more than 20 years, before moving into a consulting role in 2018. Kelsch, a vibrant encyclopedia of All Things Judy Garland, has been preserving and promoting the entertainer\\'s legacy since the 1980s. He was instrumental in creating the current museum, which includes a gallery of Garland memorabilia (dresses, posters, the carriage she rode into the Emerald City) attached to her childhood home — a white clapboard house resembling the one that crushed the Wicked Witch of the East. Though Garland left Grand Rapids when she was 4, Kelsch says she had fond memories of the town where she made her stage debut at her parents\\' vaudeville theater (now Rapids Brewing). The stolen ruby slippers are actually one of five known pairs created for \"Oz.\" In 2005, the soon-to-be-stolen pair was on its fourth visit to Grand Rapids. Kelsch first borrowed the shoes from their longtime owner, a California collector named Michael Shaw, for the town\\'s celebration of \"Oz\\'s\" 50th anniversary in 1989, which drew an estimated 30,000 people. The morning of the theft, Kelsch rushed to the museum to find a hole smashed through a back door\\'s window and glass scattered into the hallway. As police examined the crime scene, they determined the thief, or thieves, could have slid along the wall to evade the motion detector and enter the gallery\\'s unlocked door. At first, it seemed as though the museum had practically rolled out the red carpet to thieves. But its security vulnerabilities were a perfect storm of misjudgments and the norms of a small-town museum. After schoolkids had set off the emergency exit\\'s alarm multiple times, the fines diminishing the museum\\'s small budget, Kelsch had the back door de-armed so as not to alert the police. (He incorrectly assumed it was re-armed overnight.) Due to poor ventilation, the gallery door was often propped open. Kelsch had acquired a safe to secure the slippers each night, but Shaw, their owner, balked at the idea of moving the fragile shoes. The museum couldn\\'t afford a guard. Within days of the theft, several people — including a few of the movie\\'s last surviving munchkins — told Kelsch they believed the shoes\\' eccentric owner was responsible. Kelsch soon learned fingers were pointing at him, too. (Most museum art thefts are inside jobs.) Kelsch got hate mail from Judy fans, including one who seethed: \"You let the world down.\" He tried to brush the negativity aside. But by 2007, the stress of the theft and the insurance company\\'s lawsuit against the museum, coupled with personal challenges, gave Kelsch severe insomnia. He ended up in the hospital for what he describes as a nervous breakdown, missing two months of work. \"Even though I hid it, I think it built up,\" he said of the stress. \"I just went out of my mind. And then depression set in.\" The law The theft took a toll on the Grand Rapids police, too. The department fielded thousands of fruitless tips: Teenagers had danced around a bonfire wearing the shoes. They were hidden in the town\\'s pink elephant statue. They were in the Smithsonian. (That\\'s a different pair.) Bob Stein, the mayor of neighboring Bovey, Minn., and a former sergeant who was one of the case\\'s lead investigators, said pursuing all those leads took time away from drug-related and violent crimes. At the same time, the police were publicly chastised for not finding the slippers. \"It was egg on our face,\" he said. Stein has nothing but praise for his former colleague Brian Mattson, who took the 2017 phone call from a mysterious middleman who offered to broker the slippers\\' return. And for the FBI agent Mattson then contacted, who worked with his colleagues to orchestrate the complex sting that recovered the slippers. But Stein says the way FBI leadership dramatically unveiled the returned slippers , during a press conference at its Twin Cities headquarters , emphasized the bureau\\'s contributions at the expense of the Grand Rapids PD. \"The victims are the community, the owner, the museum, everybody that was accused, and all the B.S. that happened,\" Stein said. \"There\\'s more to this story and I\\'ve always said, the truth will be stranger than fiction.\" Grand Rapids \\' current police chief, Andy Morgan, also a former lead investigator on the case, doesn\\'t share Stein\\'s complaints, but echoed his sentiments about the theft\\'s intrigue. \"I look forward to the day where the case is completely available and the whole story can be told,\" he said, \"because I think all kinds of people will be all kinds of amazed.\" The town Grand Rapids\\' embrace of Garland was always somewhat reluctant. While plenty of residents proudly claim their grandmothers used to babysit young Judy, others would rather the town not be associated with a celebrity known for substance abuse. Some hear Garland\\'s name and shrug. During a recent happy hour at Klockow Brewing, none of the regulars had been following the case\\'s latest developments. (The FBI returned the slippers to Shaw in February; one of Martin\\'s associates, long involved in retail theft, was indicted in March .) Barstool consensus suggested being the site of a notorious, nonviolent crime could benefit the town. Grand Rapids had been identified with logging and mining. Now it was internationally known for a globe-shocking, bordering-on-ridiculous burglary. \"The theft itself was like an artifact of the town history,\" said bartender/artist Nathan Bergstedt, who once performed in a dinner theater\\'s neo-noir spoof of the heist for the town\\'s annual Judy Garland festival. (\"It brought down the house.\") The theft had embarrassed and dumbfounded locals, but they could also embrace its quirky appeal, said Andy Clockow, the brewery\\'s co-owner. \"The fact that there\\'s this little legend attached to the town can only do good.\" The future These days, the internet has diffused our collective attention. True entertainment legends are scarce, making the universally known ones more significant. Though millennials may not know Judy Garland, they know \"Dorothy and \\'The Wizard of Oz,\\' \" said Crowe, the local historian. And they\\'re showing the film to their kids (once they\\'re old enough not to have nightmares about the flying monkeys). That\\'s why Kelsch and the current museum director, Janie Heitz, recently testified at the Legislature , asking the state to help the museum acquire the slippers when Shaw auctions them later this year. In 2012, a pair of the slippers sold for an estimated $2 million to a group of benefactors, including Leonardo DiCaprio. They\\'re now displayed at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in Los Angeles. Considering the \"provenance\" of the stolen pair, Kelsch noted, bidding could go sky-high. Though Garland has been dead for half a century, the museum still attracts about 25,000 visitors a year, from as far away as England. Guests\\' most-asked question? What happened to the ruby slippers? That gives Heitz and Kelsch confidence the story of the theft will have its own intrigue, especially after new films about the caper come out.

       "  'description': 'Several drivers for Team Penske were disciplined.',\n",
       "  'content': 'The reigning Indianapolis 500 champion has been stripped of his victory in a different race for manipulating his push-to-pass system. According to the Associated Press , Josef Newgarden of Team Penske was disqualified from the season-opening Firestone Grand Prix of St. Petersburg, which he won on March 10. His teammate, Scott McLaughlin, who finished third, was also disqualified. Will Power, who finished fourth at St. Pete, was not disqualified, but he was docked 10 points. All three Penske entries were fined $25,000 and forfeited all prize money associated with the race. “Very disappointing,” Owner Roger Penske said in a text message to The Associated Press. “I am embarrassed.” Other owners also expressed concern over the violations since Penske is considered a legend in motor sports. The is the second cheating offense for the team this season after Joey Logano was fined $10,000 and docked his second-place starting position for a NASCAR race at Atlanta after he was caught wearing an illegal glove during his qualifying run. “I’ve emulated Roger Penske for many years on and off the track, so today’s news is quite a disappointment for me,” rival team owner Chip Ganassi told the AP. “This is a blemish on his team, their organization and the series. Very disappointing as a fellow owner and competitor in the series.” The disqualifications gave the victory to Pato O’Ward, who finished second. IndyCar said the manipulation wasn’t discovered until a warmup in Long Beach, California on April 21. “The integrity of the IndyCar Series championship is critical to everything we do,” IndyCar president Jay Frye said. “While the violation went undetected at St. Petersburg, IndyCar discovered the manipulation during Sunday’s warmup in Long Beach and immediately addressed it ensuring all cars were compliant for the Acura Grand Prix of Long Beach. “Beginning with this week’s race at Barber Motorsports Park, new technical inspection procedures will be in place to deter this violation.” The Team Penske drivers are accused of manipulating the overtake system so they could use push-to-pass on starts and restarts. According to IndyCar rules, the use of the overtake isn’t available until the car reaches the alternate start-finish line. Team Penske president Tim Cindric said in a statement that the “push-to-pass software was not removed as it should have been, following recently completed hybrid testing in the Team Penske Indy cars.” Newgarden, a two-time IndyCar champion, fell from first in points to 11th with the disqualification.',\n",

       "  'content': 'SHAQUILLE O\\'Neal has taunted his NBA on TNT colleague Charles Barkley after a bold on-air prediction came true. The NBA legend, 52, correctly predicted a win for the Miami Heat over the Boston Celtics on Wednesday. O\\'Neal sided with his former team despite their underdog status in Game 2 of the playoff showdown at the TD Garden. Without injured star man Jimmy Butler, the No. 8 seeded Heat had been blown out 114-94 in the opening game of the series. But Shaq was confident they would hit back on Wednesday. \"Miami by 10 points today,\" he boldly declared when asked for his prediction prior to tip-off. \"Bet me!\" yelled back a shocked Barkley, asking for an on-air wager. The Heat trailed 61-58 at the half - but Shaq remained adamant his former team would come through. \"They\\'re shooting great, I would double whatever the bet is Chuck,\" he said during the half-time show. \"They are going to steal this game.\" Tyler Herro put up 24 points and center Bam Adebayo collected 10 rebounds as the Heat stunned the Celtics 111-101. \"Shaq had the script!\" gasped one fan in response on X, after O\\'Neal was dubbed \"Shaqstradamus.\" TNT host Ernie Johnson brought up the tweet in the post-game show, calling Shaq\\'s prediction \"impressive.\" \"I have got to hand it to you,\" he said, \"You called it on the number.\" O\\'Neal began to taunt Barkley after being asked to \"answer his phone\" by panelist Kenny Smith. He brought up a wad of fake banknotes to his ear, pretending to be on his cellphone. \"Pat Reilly? That was a hell of a game man,\" he joked, pretending to address the president of the Heat. They are going to steal this game. \"You\\'re a man of your word, Chuck!\" Shaq shouted, waving the notes around in glee. The Heat\\'s surprise win levels the series at 1-1 before Game 3 in Miami on Saturday night. Injured star Butler took to social media to taunt the Celtics after the unexpected victory. Miami hit 23 total 3-pointers, its most ever in a playoff game, per ESPN. \"We\\'ve been doubted a lot through our playoff runs, people saying we couldn\\'t do a lot of stuff that we did,\" said Adebayo in his post-game press conference. \"So for me and my team, why lose belief now? \"Our backs are against the wall. Everybody\\'s against us. So just use that as fuel.\"',\n",

       "  'content': \"THIS is the dramatic moment Vladimir Putin's $100million (£80million) surface-to-air missile launcher is eviscerated by Ukraine in Russia's latest battlefield embarrassment. The multi-million pound Buk-M1 missile system is instantly blown to smithereens as it's struck by a Ukrainian High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS), fired by Ukraine's 3rd Special Operations Regiment. The high-end military weapon appeared to have been aiming for its next target prior to the devastating attack. Video uploaded to social media then showed the aftermath of the explosion as charred parts of armoury rained down on the floor below. Plumes of thick white smoke then engulfed the sky before an orange fireball appears from beneath. The Ukrainian Special Operations Forces (SSO) reported the destruction of the Russian Buk-M1 anti-aircraft missile complex via Telegram. “The Buk-M1, which was preparing to launch missiles, was destroyed,” the caption to the released video read. according to the Kyiv Post . Russia's multi-million pound weapon was discovered by operators of Ukraine’s 3rd Separate Regiment of the SSO during reconnaissance missions “in one of the most active areas.” SSO operators then relayed the target coordinates to the missile artillery unit of the Ukrainian Defence Forces, who took swift action on the missile launcher. And according to special operations forces, the Russian missile launcher didn't even have time to fire a single missile before it was destroyed. With the military vehicle valued at approximately $100million (£79.9million), it comes as a major blow and huge embarrassment to Putin and his forces. “The Buk-M1 didn’t have time to launch a single missile – it was promptly destroyed,” the statement said. The Buk-M1 surface-to-air defence missile system is intended to defeat tactical and strategic aircraft, cruise missiles, helicopters and other aerodynamic targets. A self-propelled, medium-range surface-to-air missile system developed by the Russian defence industry, it can also strike down ballistic missiles, antiradar missiles and other high precision weapons. The systems battery requires five minutes to set up before it is ready for engagement, according to ArmyRecognition.com , and can be ready for transit again within five minutes. The reaction time of the battery from target tracking to missile launch is around 22 seconds, it's added. Manned by a crew of three, the Buk-M1 fires missiles at a terryfing speed of 1,901mph. It also boasts an impressive range of 32-35km. The destruction of the Buk-M1 missile system is just the latest in a long line of battlefield blows for Putin and his forces. Earlier this month, an elite Ukrainian unit staged a daring three-day mission to capture a £1million Russian tank suspected of carrying secret technology. The 12th Azov brigade risked their lives to sneak across the frontline and steal a T-72 because Kyiv feared it was able to repel its drones. It came after a column of Russian tanks and 50 soldiers were wiped out by Ukraine in one Putin's most humiliating battlefield blows yet. Dramatic footage shared by soldiers of the Azov Brigade shows the military vehicles being blown to bits before they manage to capture one of Russia's new tanks. In March, chilling footage also showed one of Putin's £1million T-72 tanks getting completely eviscerated by a Ukrainian suicide drone . The dramatic moment captured the Russian tank making its way across the battlefield before it gets suddenly blown to smithereens. Russia also continues to take heavy hits on its oil refineries after yet another was hit by Ukraine on Thursday. Footage captured the dramatic moment the huge inferno also destroyed one of Putin's trains during the sabotage attack close to Omsk Oil Refinery in southwest Russia .\",\n",

       "  'content': 'Ranbir Kapoor Goes Through Major Transformation For Ramayana, Photos Revealed By is set to play the character of Lord Ram in Nitesh Tiwari’s highly anticipated Ramayana. The actor has made it to the headlines for his remarkable physical transformation for the role. The reputed celebrity fitness trainer, Shivohaam, recently shared photos that revealed the actor’s rigorous preparation for the role. Ranbir Kapoor’s evolution extends beyond mere physical changes. Earlier this month, another of Ranbir’s trainers, Nam, posted a clip of the actor’s intense workouts. In that video, his wife Alia Bhatt, and daughter, Raha, also made a brief appearance in the background. The film is set to be a landmark project and the excitement surrounding it is palpable. This epic film will be another addition to Kapoor’s illustrious filmography. Ranbir Kapoor’s trainer reveals transformation photos for Ramayana As per Shivohaam’s recent Instagram post, Ranbir’s physical transformation is the result of “hard work over three-plus years.” The celebrity trainer also emphasized the absence of shortcuts in achieving such feats. Shivohaam added, “Nothing is ever achieved by taking shortcuts in life. Clarity and a vision of the end goal with a proper planned and structured program to reach that goal is essential.” The Instagram post featured a string of images that captured Ranbir’s physical transformation for the making of Animal Park as well as the upcoming Ramayana film. Ranbir Kapoor showed off his chiseled body and six-pack abs, which indicate his dedication to acting. Shivohaam also credited Kapoor’s willpower and dedication as the reasons behind his remarkable transformation. He stated, “Then again, if you don’t have the WILL, DISCIPLINE, CONSISTENCY, and FIRE to achieve the goals, no amount of planning and structure will help.” Fans hope that portrayal of Lord Rama will be instrumental in the film’s performance at the box office. The actor’s dedication to preparing for this role has already set high expectations and generated immense anticipation for its release.

       "  'description': 'Congo’s government is questioning Apple about the tech company’s knowledge of “blood minerals” from a conflict zone in the African country that could be smuggled into supply chains',\n",
       "  'content': 'Congo ’s government is questioning Apple about the tech company’s knowledge of “blood minerals” from a conflict zone in the African country that could be smuggled into its supply chains and is demanding answers within three weeks. A group of international lawyers representing Congo said Thursday that they sent letters to Apple’s CEO Tim Cook and its French subsidiary this week, raising concerns about human rights violations involving the minerals extracted from mines in the country’s troubled east that might end up being used in the company’s products. They included a list of questions challenging Apple to show how it monitors its supply chains in a region where more than 100 armed rebel groups operate, some of whom have been accused of carrying out mass killings of civilians. Writing to Cook , the lawyers said “it has become clear to us that year after year, Apple has sold technology made with minerals sourced from a region whose population is being devastated by grave violations of human rights.” “The iPhones, Mac computers and accessories that Apple sells to its customers around the world rely on supply chains that are too opaque, and that are tainted by the blood of the Congolese people,” the lawyers said. Eastern Congo is one of the most mineral-rich regions in the world but is also the site of a huge humanitarian disaster , with the armed groups fighting for years for control of the mines and the valuable minerals in them, and millions of people displaced and affected by worsening violence. The situation has deteriorated badly in the last few months. Apple’s press representatives in Europe didn’t respond to a request for comment. Apple, which has a market value of around $2.6 trillion, has denied using minerals from mines and regions where human rights violations take place and says it conducts business ethically. It said in a 2023 report that it “responsibly” sources minerals in Congo and its neighboring countries. The minerals it buys don’t finance war or armed groups, it says. The lawyers for the Congo government said “those claims do not appear to be based on concrete, verifiable evidence.” The Congo government said it has suspicions that some of the tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold — known as the 3TG critical minerals — that Apple sources from suppliers is smuggled out of Congo to neighboring Rwanda and then infiltrated into the global supply chain. The 3TG minerals are key components in electronics. Congo has accused Rwanda of financing and directing the notorious armed rebel group M23 in eastern Congo to help extract minerals illegally. Rwanda denies that but tensions between the countries are increasingly high, while M23 and other groups are accused of regularly carrying out attacks that include the killing and raping of civilians, according to Human Rights Watch. The lawyers for the Congo government quoted a 2022 report by the nongovernmental organization Global Witness that claimed Apple had previously applied “few meaningful mitigation measures” to avoid using smuggled minerals. The Congo government was now seeking “effective redress” against “end-users of blood minerals” across the world, the lawyers said. They asked Apple to respond to questions over its supply chain controls within three weeks and said they had compiled a report on “the laundering” of Congo’s minerals by Rwanda and private entities that would be made public this month. They also would seek instructions from the Congo government as to what legal measures it is considering against Apple, the letter said. ___ AP Business Writer Kelvin Chan in London contributed to this report. ___ AP Africa news: https://apnews.com/hub/africa',\n",

       "  'content': 'Harvey Weinstein ‘s 2020 rape conviction has been overturned. The decision was made today (April 25) by the New York Court of Appeals. He will still remain in prison due to his conviction for rape in a 2022 Los Angeles court case. Keep reading to find out more... In 2020, Weinstein was found guilty of sexually assaulting Project Runway production assistant Miriam Haley at his apartment in 2006 and was also convicted of the rape of another woman, Jessica Mann , in 2013. The case was appealed and New York State’s highest court heard the case in February. Weinstein ‘s lawyers argued that the judge in the 2020 trial allowed three women to testify against him at the time whose allegations were not related to the case at hand. The judge today ruled that a new trial must now take place for this 2020 conviction. Judge Jenny Rivera said in today’s ruling (via THR ), “Under our system of justice, the accused has a right to be held to account only for the crime charged and, thus, allegations of prior bad acts may not be admitted against them for the sole purpose of establishing their propensity for criminality. Nor may the prosecution use ‘prior convictions or proof of the prior commission of specific, criminal, vicious or immoral acts’ other than to impeach the accused’s credibility. It is our solemn duty to diligently guard these rights regardless of the crime charged, the reputation of the accused, or the pressure to convict.” The Judge continued, “Defendant was convicted by a jury for various sexual crimes against three named complainants and, on appeal, claims that he was judged, not on the conduct for which he was indicted, but on irrelevant, prejudicial, and untested allegations of prior bad acts. We conclude that the trial court erroneously admitted testimony of uncharged, alleged prior sexual acts against persons other than the complainants of the underlying crimes because that testimony served no material non-propensity purpose. The court compounded that error when it ruled that defendant, who had no criminal history, could be cross examined about those allegations as well as numerous allegations of misconduct that portrayed defendant in a highly prejudicial light. The synergistic effect of these errors was not harmless.”',\n",

       "  'description': 'With the first round of the 2024 NFL draft set to unfold on Thursday, let’s take a deep look at some intriguing prop bets to make across the betting industry.',\n",
       "  'content': 'With free agency in the rearview mirror, the NFL draft is the next big event on the NFL off-season calendar. Throughout the weekend, teams will be infused with young talent, and positional groups will begin to crystalize. Even with NHL and NBA playoffs going on, it’s the NFL Draft that will capture the sporting world this weekend. Of course, to add to the excitement, you can bet on the NFL Draft. In recent years, betting on the draft has become more and more common and the betting market has predicted some sharp movement in the draft ahead of time. NOTE: Betting on the NFL Draft is NOT legal in all states. It IS legal in these: AZ, CO, IA, IL, IN, KS, LA, MA, MD, ME, MI, NC, NH, NJ, OH, OR, TN, WV, and WY. When you bet on the NFL Draft , there’s plenty of markets to get involved with. You can bet on which player will be drafted at what position in the draft, you can bet which position each team will draft, you can bet whether a player will go before or after the listed pick, and you can bet on a variety of other markets. We’ve run through the draft props markets at a variety of sportsbooks and these five have stood out as worthy of a bet. Over the last few weeks, the hype train has been rolling for former Michigan quarterback J.J. McCarthy. There was speculation that teams inside the top three were interested, and there was also speculation that a team like Minnesota might be interested in moving up high in the draft to select him. However, recent reports say that Minnesota is only interested in moving up to the top five of the draft if Drake Maye is available. With Maye, Caleb Williams and Jayden Daniels expected to make up the top-three of the draft, the consensus opinion is that Arizona will go wide-receiver at pick four and the Chargers will either bolster their offensive line or add a weapon for Justin Herbert. The Giants pick at six and there has been some smoke there, but if he drops to pick number six, we cash the over on this bet. You can bet McCarthy to get picked outside the top five at +135 odds at BetRivers Sportsbook . New users who sign up for BetRivers ahead of the draft can claim a no-sweat first bet worth up to $500. Sometimes, it’s smart to jump on the train while there’s still value. An offensive lineman out of Alabama, J.C. Latham has long been considered a first round talent. However, over the course of the last week, Latham has gone from +400 to +100 to be taken inside the top ten. At some sportsbooks, he’s even minus-odds at this point. Daniel Jeremiah mocked him to Los Angeles at pick five in his final mock draft. Even if he falls behind the Chargers, it wouldn’t at all be shocking to see either New York team, Tennessee, or Chicago add to their offensive line behind them in the top ten. As of Wednesday night, you could bet Latham to be a top-10 pick at +100 odds at DraftKings Sportsbook . Move quickly, as these odds are getting chopped down quickly across the market. New users who sign up with DraftKings can get $200 in bonus bets instantly after placing their first $5 wager. The Philadelphia Eagles collapsed down the stretch last season due mainly to their defense’s inability to make stops. The last memory Eagles’ fans have of last season is Baker Mayfield moving the ball down the field with ease in their wild-card loss. The top two cornerbacks on the Eagles’ depth chart are the aging and declining duo of Darius Slay and James Bradberry. For a team like Philadelphia that is smack-dab in the middle of a championship window, it makes sense to draft for need, especially when their need is this obvious. Thankfully, you can still get plus-money (+105) at Caesars Sportsbook on the Eagles drafting a cornerback with their first pick. New users who sign up with Caesars Sportsbook can claim up to $1,000 in bonus bets if their first bet fails to produce a winner. Going into the offseason, most viewed it as mandatory that the Chiefs provide Patrick Mahomes a legitimate outside weapon. By signing Marquise Brown in free agency, they did enough to give themselves the flexibility to address other areas of weakness in the early parts of the draft. Orlando Brown Jr. is off to Cincinnati after signing a mega deal in free-agency. Jawaan Taylor struggled mightily at times at right tackle last season. The Chiefs need to keep Mahomes upright and in the pocket, meaning addressing the offensive line is a must. Thankfully, there’s nearly double-digit offensive linemen who are expected to be taken in Round 1 on Thursday. BetMGM Sportsbook is offering +140 odds on the Chiefs to go offensive line and avoid the allure of adding to their weapons early on. This team has shown restraint in drafting pass-catching weapons in the past, and we expect that to continue on Thursday. New users who sign up for BetMGM Sportsbook using promo code MLIVEMGM can get up to $1,500 in bonus bets if their first wager doesn’t win. Will Michael Penix Jr. be drafted in the first round of Thursday’s draft? That’s basically the question when making this pick. He’s an overwhelming favorite to sneak into the first round. Being drafted past pick 32 has +280 odds at FanDuel Sportsbook . At those odds, we’re willing to take a chance on Penix falling. Every year, it seems like the mock drafting and fantasy community is too optimistic when it comes to the quarterback class. Last season, Will Levis and Hendon Hooker were talked up as potential first- round picks. The year prior to that, names like Desmond Ridder, Malik Willis and Sam Howell were talked about before becoming day two and day three picks. Penix is an older prospect, as he turns 24 in a few days. Hooker was an older prospect in last year’s draft, and it didn’t work out overly well for him as he fell into the third round. Analytics and models aren’t as impressed by older quarterbacks beating up on college competition. In addition, Penix has a long history of injuries with two shoulder and two knee injuries in his six college seasons. It took six college seasons for Penix to reach this level. While that may be viewed as a nice story of perseverance, it’s also a red flag for NFL evaluators. We’ll take a shot on Penix falling out of Round 1 and being picked over pick 32.5 at +280 odds. New users who sign up for FanDuel Sportsbook can claim $150 in bonus bets guaranteed after placing a $5 wager.

       "  'content': 'STATELINE, Nev. – When it comes to hip-hop legends, Afroman stands tall, his infectious beats and hilarious lyrics etching a permanent mark in the music industry. With his unmistakable raspy voice and laid-back delivery, the iconic rapper has captivated audiences worldwide, leaving them in stitches and craving more. Afroman’s claim to fame, the uproarious track “Because I Got High,” is a testament to his unique humor and storytelling prowess. The song, inspired by his inability to clean up his room, quickly became an anthem for the cannabis community and a cultural phenomenon. Its catchy hook and relatable lyrics struck a chord with listeners, propelling it to the top of the charts and earning Afroman a coveted spot on the soundtrack of Kevin Smith’s cult classic, “Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back.” “Because I Got High” has the distinction of being the No. 1 downloaded ringtone in the world. In 2002, “Because I Got High” was nominated for a Grammy for Best Rap Solo Performance. But Afroman’s success extends far beyond this chart-topping hit. With a six-record deal with Universal Records under his belt, the rapper has embarked on a whirlwind tour, playing sold-out shows and leaving audiences in stitches with his infectious energy and witty banter. Afroman’s ability to seamlessly blend comedy and music has earned him a dedicated following, solidifying his status as a true entertainer.

       "  'content': 'Forget the referees and their missed calls . Former NBA star and Philadelphia native Rasheed Wallace had someone else in the crosshairs while trying to explain why the 76ers are in a 2-0 series hole against the Knicks entering Thursday’s Game 3: $180 million man Tobias Harris. “I can’t really blame Buddy [Hield], though. He just got here. I can motherf—king blame Tobias with his s–t though,” Wallace said on “ Sheed & Tyler .” “If you listening, we mad with you too, dog. You gotta step that s–t the f—k up. Yo, you getting all that bread. We need more than 5-for-12 (sic) for 10 points. We need more than that from him.” Warning: Graphic language \"I can motherf**kin\\' blame Tobias [Harris] with his sh*t though. Yeah, and if you listening, we mad with you too, dog. You gotta step that sh*t the f**k up. Yo, you gettin\\' all that bread. We need more than 5-12 for 10 points.\" Rasheed Wallace’s thoughts on Tobias Harris pic.twitter.com/2PuqNS17U5 Harris is being paid $39.3 million this season and is supposed to be one of the 76ers’ core players, but he has largely been invisible offensively against the Knicks. One of the 76ers’ problems has been a lack of production from anyone not named Tyrese Maxey and Joel Embiid, and Harris is a large part of that problem. Harris tallied just seven points on 3-for-7 shooting in Game 1, and then tallied 10 points on 4-for-11 shooting in the stunning Game 2 loss . He’s averaging a measly 8.5 points, less than half of his season average of 17.2. To his credit, Harris has grabbed nine rebounds in each game. Wallace, who played for the Knicks in his final season in 2012-13, said Harris needs to find other ways to affect the game if his shot isn’t falling. “Here’s the whole key how you step up — it’s not a matter of, ‘OK, I had a bad shooting game tonight, so now I gotta go out here tonight, Game 2, and prove that I can shoot,’ and now you might shoot horrendous again,” Wallace said. “You gotta make that difference within the game. You can be a little extra greedy because what’s happening, all they doing is switching. Mitch [Robinson] is a good defender, he’s a good shot-blocker, but at times when he comes out, other than that, they ain’t go no shot-blocker in there like when Embiid go to the bench, we ain’t got no shot-blockers in there. “You gotta go at it, dog. You gotta go at it hard. Just come with that, as we said, that young boy energy, that full energy.”',\n",

What they are doing is going into robotaxis and going to make the low-cost cars,\" Baron said on CNBC\\'s \"Squawk Box\" on Thursday. \"Overall, they have to do five million new cars.\" The Baron Capital chairman and CEO previously revealed that his firm has made about 20 times its investment in Tesla since he first bought the stock in 2014. Tesla is the biggest holding in Baron\\'s oldest and biggest fund, Baron Partners Fund (BPTIX), accounting for more than 30% of the portfolio. The fund is down more than 17% this year amid a 35% decline in Tesla shares. \"So what I think about the reason the stock is down is people were concerned he was going to abandon the idea of having a low-cost car and go all in to robotaxis,\" he said, referring to Tesla CEO Musk . Austin, Texas-based Tesla got a boost earlier this week after Musk told investors that production of new, affordable EV models could begin sooner than expected. Still, Tesla reported a 9% drop in first-quarter revenue, the biggest decline since 2012, as the company weathers the effect of ongoing price cuts. TSLA 1Y mountain Tesla shares over past 12 months.

       "  'content': 'A Russian court ordered the seizure of $439.5 million in funds from JPMorgan Chase’s bank accounts in Russia that the largest American lender froze after the Ukraine invasion, according to a court filing. The court’s ruling Wednesday comes after state-owned VTB Bank filed a lawsuit in a St. Petersburg arbitration court after the Russian bank was hit with sanctions following the invasion. JPMorgan declined to comment on the Russian court’s interim measures. VTB did not immediately comment on Wednesday. It has previously declined to comment on its legal disputes with JPMorgan Chase. The Russian court ordered the seizure of all funds in JPMorgan’s Russian accounts as well as “movable and immovable property,” including the bank’s stake in a Russian subsidiary, according to a court order published by the Arbitration Court of St Petersburg and the Leningrad Region. The ruling noted that the court had not taken securities and property held by JPMorgan, or the jpmorgan.ru domain. The next hearing in the Russian case is July 17. JPMorgan tried to block VTB’s efforts by filing its own suit in New York last week. In a complaint filed in federal court in Manhattan, JPMorgan described VTB’s attempt to recover the money in Russia as a “blatant breach” of its agreement to have disputes addressed in New York. Subscribe to our daily Business Report newsletter! Please provide a valid email address. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy . Never miss a story. JPMorgan noted in its filing that US law prohibits it from releasing the $439.5 million, and VTB, Russia’s second-largest bank, will try to seize its assets abroad if it prevails in the Russia lawsuit. It said VTB’s prospects there were good, with Russian courts having granted at least six other Russian banks relief against US and European banks that were required to comply with sanctions laws. “Thus, JPMorgan is immediately facing a certain Russian judgment exposing its assets to seizure, without timely or assured recourse, simply because it is abiding, as it must, with US law,” JPMorgan’s lawyers said at the time. The Russian court’s ruling came just after President Joe Biden signed a foreign aid bill into law, giving US officials new powers to locate and seize Russian assets in the US, as well as obtain Russian state assets from European allies to use as aid for Ukraine. Biden’s administration has said that it already has a $1 billion military aid package for Ukraine in the works — the first sourced from the bill, two US officials told Reuters . It includes vehicles, Stinger air defense munitions, additional ammunition for high-mobility artillery rocket systems, 155 millimeter artillery ammunition, TOW and Javelin anti-tank munitions and other weapons that can immediately be put to use on the battlefield, the officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity. However, the bill must first jump its last hurdle — final approval in the Senate — before the Biden administration will send any additional aid, though it’s nearly guaranteed to pass. Biden has asked for Congress to pass a much larger, $60.8 billion in aid to Ukraine, but the initiative stalled when Republicans in the House of Representatives refused to move the measure forward for months. In response to the expected renewed US aid, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu on Tuesday said Moscow would “increase the intensity of attacks on logistics centers and storage bases for Western weapons” in Ukraine, according to the ministry’s Telegram channel. Noting the desperate situation , Ryder said the Pentagon would “do everything we can to lean forward, employ [our] robust logistics network capability, employ the relationships that we’ve built with our international allies and partners to get a [package] there quickly.” “Needless to say we understand the importance and the urgency and are doing everything we can to be poised to respond quickly,” he added.

       "  'content': 'A sign on the New York State Thruway has many drivers scratching their heads. The highways of New York go by many names. Southern parts of I-87 are informally referred to as the Thruway, while the interstate is known as the Northway above Albany. Route 17 also changes from the Southern Tier Expressway to the Quickway, and eventually (maybe) will be known simply as I-86. Aside from these names, sections of highways also have special designations given to them as a tribute to different groups of people. These names can\\'t be found on official maps and are not usually used by GPS software, but the ceremonial names can be identified by bright blue road signs in New York. One such sign has boggled New York drivers traveling through the Hudson Valley not for what it says, but how it says it. A section of I-87 in Rockland County has been dedicated as the Jewish Veterans Memorial Highway. I don\\'t think anyone would argue that this is certainly a group of brave individuals who deserve recognition, but the way the sign is printed is confusing at best. The bright blue sign just before Exit 14B shows the word \"Jewish\" in all capital letters floating up in the right-hand corner of the sign. It\\'s so far removed from the rest of the name of the highway that many drivers say they didn\\'t even know it had anything to do with Jewish veterans. In a recent Facebook thread, some drivers admit they always thought the stretch of I-87 was called the War Veterans Memorial Highway and, for some reason, it was also recognizing that the road went through a historically Jewish area of New York. It\\'s not hard to blame anyone for being confused, especially since other War Veteran memorial highways in New York look nothing like this one. A stretch of I-287 in New York is designated as Westchester County War Veterans Memorial Highway. That sign is properly formatted, with \"Westchester County\" capitalized to match the rest of the sign. There\\'s no question what this highway is called. One Facebook commenter says the sign on I-87 looks more like an area designation than a tribute to Jewish war veterans. This kind of reads as “I-87 JEWISH” as though there’s a separate road. Like “I-80 BUSINESS” signs. Comparing the two, it honestly does look like that. Other critics say the Jewish War Veterans sign looks like it was an afterthought, with the word \"Jewish\" sloppily slapped onto a generic sign which, if true, would be terribly disrespectful. My guess is that they renamed the highway and couldn\\'t be bothered to make a new sign. They either didn\\'t bother to check the font or they figured that all caps would take up more space. Someone else commented that the sign looks as though it was edited in Microsoft Word and the operator couldn\\'t figure out text wrapping. We decided to do some editing of our own and quickly made a mock-up of what the road sign should actually look like. I think everyone can agree that this sign is much more aesthetically pleasing, and leaves no room for confusion. We want to know what you think.

RELATED: Answering your new Minnesota state flag questions The Luverne native doesn\\'t have a design background but says he did a lot of studying. \"Vexillology research, which is about experts in flags,\" he said. \"Polling on different websites to see what people wanted to see on the flag, and I also did a lot of research into Minnesota history and culture.\" Prekker\\'s original design was modified by the the State Emblems Redesign Commission, which kept the North Star and abstract shape of Minnesota, but nixed the stripes and opted for all blue, which Prekker says represents water. It\\'s gotten pushback from some who wanted more of a say on the new flag. Prekker says he doesn\\'t take the criticism personally.

Right now, Minnesota\\'s flag shows a White settler tilling land as an Indigenous man rides off on horseback. Many consider the imagery racist . The redesign commission spent four months considering more than 2,100 submissions from the public . Flag expert Ted Kaye, secretary of the North American Vexillological Association, told WCCO in December he gives the final design an A+ . \"It\\'s different from all other U.S. state flags and actually most flags that I\\'ve seen,\" Kaye said. \"This special stylized form of the state is a very unusual flag design element.\" RELATED: YouTuber\\'s critique of Minnesota state flag finalists draws 1 million views He compared the backlash in Minnesota to the fierce debate in Canada in the 60s when it adopted its now-iconic maple leaf flag. \"People went crazy,\" he said. \"And now it\\'s considered one of the best flags in the world, so I have a feeling Minnesota with some time, they\\'re going love this new flag.\" READ MORE: Could Minnesota lawmakers change the new state flag and seal designs? Some Minnesota Republican lawmakers announced earlier this month they want to halt the new flag\\'s rollout and give Minnesotans a chance to provide more feedback on the design. \"Minnesotans deserve the right to vote for what represents them. If that flag is this one or if that flag is the new one, it\\'s a Minnesotan\\'s right to vote,\" said Rep. Bjorn Olson, R-Fairmont. Republicans introduced three flag-related bills, including one pushing for a referendum on the design that would be put to voters. READ MORE: Crow Wing County Board plans to take concerns over new flag design to Minnesota governor Olson, and Democratic Gov.

So they can debate it in the legislature, we will see where it goes.\" The new flag makes its official debut on Flag Day, May 11. Stephen Swanson is a web producer at WCCO.

       "  'description': \"One of Americans' biggest retirement fears is running out of money. BlackRock hopes a new way to take paycheck-like withdrawals from investments may help.\",\n",
       "  'content': 'Patchareeporn Sakoolchai | Moment | Getty Images BlackRock , the largest asset manager, has launched a new product to help workers their retirement savings into a regular income stream that mimics the paycheck they receive during their working years. Experts say while the new choice could be helpful, its success will be defined by whether consumers actually take advantage of it. The BlackRock product, called LifePath Paycheck , aims to make one choice simpler — how to withdraw from lifetime investments — that workers now face after a broad shift from defined benefit plans like pensions to defined contribution plans like 401(k) plans. \"We\\'re talking about a revolution in retirement,\" BlackRock CEO Larry Fink wrote of LifePath Paycheck in his recent annual letter to investors. The strategy provides guaranteed income through a target-date fund , which typically provide a mix of stocks, bonds and other investments that become more conservative as an investor nears their anticipated retirement age. More from Personal Finance: Most retirees don\\'t delay Social Security benefits Women reaching \\'peak 65\\' more likely to struggle in retirement Americans think they need almost $1.5 million to retire Employees who opt in to LifePath Paycheck through their employer-provided retirement plan will start making allocations to lifetime income starting at age 55. Then, starting at age 591⁄2 and up until the year they turn 72, they may start regular withdrawals from that sum. While they receive that income, the rest of their retirement savings may continue to grow. A recent BlackRock survey found 60% of employees worry they may outlive their retirement savings. Other research from the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies has similarly found the greatest retirement fear for workers 50 and up is running out of their savings and investments. Around 500,000 employees now have access to the strategy through 14 retirement plan sponsors, according to BlackRock. For now, the LifePath product is limited to plans offered through employers. But BlackRock would eventually love to make a similar option available through funds for individuals who do not have access to employer plans, Anne Ackerley, head of retirement at BlackRock, said during a Wednesday presentation in New York. watch now VIDEO 2:49 02:49 BlackRock CEO Larry Fink: Younger generations don\\'t know who to listen to about retirement Mad Money with Jim Cramer While the development may start in the U.S. first, Fink predicted in his annual letter that it will likely spread to other countries. \"I believe it will one day be the most used investment strategy in defined contribution plans,\" Fink wrote. Investor utilization key to success Experts say much of the strategy\\'s success will depend on whether employees opt in. For sustainable energy company Avangrid, implementing LifePath Paycheck has provided a way to smooth its recent transition from a defined benefit to defined contribution plan, said Paul Visconti, senior director of total health and retirement programs at the company. \"Adding this feature to it really ... gives some of the legacy employees some of that comfort they have from the legacy pension plan,\" Visconti said. The company hopes the benefit feature will help attract and retain employees in a competitive industry, he said. However, because it just went live at Avangrid on Monday, the company does not yet have data on how many employees age 55 and older may have signed up. However, the company has been actively educating its 8,000 employees on the offering. Annuity options in retirement plans will likely become as widely embraced as target-date funds are today, predicts Jason Fichtner, chief economist at the Bipartisan Policy Center and executive director at the Alliance for Lifetime Income\\'s Retirement Income Institute. Annuity income helps retirees understand how much they can spend, while also letting them better absorb risks in other areas of their investment portfolio, he said. Moreover, having income through an annuity may help worker create an income bridge that enables them to delay claiming Social Security retirement benefits, according to joint research from the Bipartisan Policy Center and BlackRock published last year. Social Security benefits are a \"life annuity\" that increases annually with inflation, \"a rare feature on the private market,\" the research notes. Moreover, for every year a retiree delays benefits from their full retirement age — typically 66 or 67 — up to age 70, they get an 8% increase, a guaranteed return that is also hard to match elsewhere. Social Security is \"unequivocally\" the first place people should look to make the most of their retirement income, said David Blanchett, managing director and head of retirement research at PGIM DC Solutions. \"Will it help people to buy this product? It would likely help them to delay claiming Social Security more,\" Blanchett said. While there have been other products offering lifetime income available in the defined contribution market for over a decade, it\\'s up to individuals to actively convert their savings to lifetime income. And few participants tend to take that step, he said. \"Very few people who end up in this product actually receive any kind of paycheck, because they don\\'t always know what they\\'re signing up for,\" Blanchett said. While many people like the idea of guaranteed fixed income, they often don\\'t seek products on their own that will provide that income stream from their retirement plan savings once they retire, said Dan Doonan, executive director at the National Institute on Retirement Security, a non-profit research and education organization. The annuity choices consumers face on their own are \"incredibly complex,\" with regard to who to buy from and assessing whether they\\'re getting a good deal, Doonan said. Having an employer plan provide these options can help remove those uncertainties and may result in higher utilization, he predicts. \"People are much more likely to do these things when they\\'re part of the plan they have at the office at work,\" Doonan said. BlackRock\\'s move will likely push other groups to enhance their retirement plan annuity options, Doonan predicts. \"It might look very different in 10 years,\" he said.',\n",

       "  'content': 'SHOPPERS have already become obsessed with Aldi\\'s cult-favourite rosé that makes its way back on shelves every summer. The Atlantique Rosé is said to be a dupe of the fancy Whispering Angel wine but is a fraction of the price. But shoppers will want to head down to Aldi stores next week as they are slashing the price even further from the usual £6.99 just in time for the bank holiday. Let\\'s be honest, even if the weather isn\\'t the best, most of us will be sitting outside enjoying a glass or two to make the most of the long weekend. And now you can stock up on your favourite wine for less than a fiver as it will be reduced to just £4.99 for a limited time. Dry and fresh, this is an easy-drinking wine that is perfect for long evenings The price drop will start on April 29 until 5 May and the deal allows customers to buy two bottles per transaction for the bargain price. Aldi bosses say: \"This rosé is an elegant, subtle wine with aromas of strawberry and watermelon, and flavours of tangy raspberry and red cherry. \"Dry and fresh, this is an easy-drinking wine that is perfect for long evenings and is sure to wow guests at any Bank Holiday celebration.\" It\\'s made in the Languedoc-Roussillon region of France , within which Provence and the Whispering Angel vineyard are found. Shoppers have raved about this wine in particular as a perfect dupe, including wine expert Affordable Wine Hunter on TikTok. “Often described as The Whispering Angel dupe, grab it while you can,\" they said. The video caption read: “Atlantique Rosé, Aldi £6:99 from Chasseaux et Fils. “I first posted this a year ago and since then it’s started to become known as the ‘Whispering Angel Dupe’. “It certainly has a similar style and it’s a great easy drinking Rosé. But if the pale-pink drink isn\\'t your thing, Aldi also has two other wines available and have slashed their prices too. The Pierre Jaurant French Merlot is perfect for summer evenings with notes of juicy red fruits and warm spices - and will be £3.49 instead of £5.99. For those looking for a nice white wine to nurse then you can pick up the Freeman’s Bay New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc for £4.99 instead of £6.79. WHEN it comes to shopping at Aldi, the best time to do so depends on what you want to buy. For reduced items - when shops open Red sticker items are rare at Aldi\\'s 830 UK stores, but the supermarket says that none of its food goes to waste so there are some to be found - if you\\'re quick. A spokesman for the supermarket said: \"All items are reduced to 50 per cent of the recommend sales price before stores open on their best before or use by dates.\" That means you have the best chance of finding reduced food items if you go into stores as soon as it opens. Opening times vary by shop but a majority open from 7am or 8am. You can find your nearest store\\'s times by using the supermarket\\'s online shop finder tool. For Specialbuys - Thursdays and Sundays Specialbuys are Aldi\\'s weekly collection of items that it doesn\\'t normally sell, which can range from pizza ovens to power tools. New stock comes into stores every Thursday and Sunday, so naturally, these are the best days to visit for the best one-off special deals. For an even better chance of bagging the best items, head there for your local store\\'s opening time. You don\\'t have to head into stores to bag a Specialbuy, though. They also go on sale online, usually at midnight on Thursday and Sunday, and you can pre-order them up to a week in advance . As long as you spend at least £25, you\\'ll get the items delivered for free. Remember: once they\\'re gone, they\\'re gone, so if there\\'s something you really want, visit as early as possible',\n",

Editors have highlightedthe following attributes while ensuring the content\\'s credibility: fact-checked peer-reviewed publication trusted source proofread by Martha Höhne, Leibniz Institute for Catalysis In most industrial chemical reactions, catalysts combine with the starting materials and accompany them through intermediate stages to the product. In chemistry, this pathway is known as the reaction mechanism, and it is a kind of black box: nobody knows what is happening at the molecular level at first. If the reaction result in the laboratory falls short of expectations, chemists first resort to trial and error. Put simply, they modify the reaction until it works. Sometimes, however, it is worth taking a closer look at the reaction mechanism , as Dr. Nora Jannsen at the Leibniz Institute for Catalysis in Rostock shows using a model reaction. She recently published her findings, which she obtained as part of her doctorate, in the Journal of the American Chemical Society . The model reaction sounds unspectacular and, above all, strange to the layman\\'s ear, explains Jannsen. \"Benzotriazole, usually a corrosion inhibitor, is converted into a new substance with an allene (the emphasis here is on the second syllable) using a rhodium catalyst .\" This is then called allylbenzotriazole and can be used in a variety of syntheses. The reaction was developed by a research group led by Prof. Breit at the University of Freiburg. The colleagues in Freiburg succeeded in precisely linking a \" functional group \" to a very specific position in benzotrialzole. This is where a nitrogen–hydrogen bond (N–H) is located, as Jannsen explains. \"Functional groups\" are important as molecular segments because they are responsible for the specific, e.g., pharmaceutical, effect. \"The Freiburg team wanted to place such a group in benzotriazole exactly where the N–H bond is, and the N–H bond has to give way for this,\" Jannsen continues. The colleagues managed to do this. \"But they didn\\'t understand on what basis they had achieved this.\" That is unfortunate. Because only with an understanding of the molecular events can the reaction be specifically applied and optimized in the future. This was the aim of Jannsen\\'s dissertation, which she successfully defended in Rostock in 2023. So how does such a reaction work? The start and end are known. What is also known about this reaction is that every single atom from the starting materials is later found in the product; chemists call this an \"atom-economic\" reaction. This means that in the course of the reaction, the hydrogen from the N–H bond must pass from the benzotriazole to the second starting material, the allene. Jannsen says, \"The Freiburg scientists thought that the catalyst breaks the nitrogen–hydrogen bond, i.e., a so-called oxidative addition of the benzotriazole takes place. Rhodium catalysts are known for this type of reaction.\" Jannsen tested the idea by first reacting the rhodium catalyst with only one starting material, benzotriazole. She isolated samples from this reaction for nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and X-ray crystal structure analysis. The result: \"The N–H bond is not broken at all. The benzotriazole remains completely intact, it only attaches itself to the catalyst.\" The chemist then discovered that the second starting substance, allen, also binds to the catalyst. And this is where the following happens: \"The two starting materials come into direct contact with each other, and the benzotriazole transfers the hydrogen atom, also known as the proton, to the allene. The catalyst merely holds the starting materials in place, but does not intervene directly in this step.\" Jannsen then substantiated this proposal in detail using quantum mechanics , i.e., by theoretically modeling the reaction pathway. Jannsen was surprised that the catalyst managed the whole thing so simply. For laypeople, it may sound a bit like a chemical rope trick. In technical terms, such a process is well known and is called protonation. This process had an advantage. Jannsen says, \"Interestingly, the reaction conditions for protonation can be significantly improved by adding another proton source.\" For example, she succeeded in reducing the reaction temperature from 80°C to room temperature by adding a type of co-catalyst. Jannsen also discovered that the benzotriazole can also block the catalyst under certain circumstances. This is the case when this starting substance occupies the catalyst twice, so that its reaction partner, the allen, cannot find a free space on the catalyst. This paralyzes the catalytic activity and leads to the catalyst being \"consumed.\" \"It probably helps here to simply add the starting material to the reaction successively so that the catalyst comes into less contact with it,\" Jannsen says.

       "  'content': 'A big Wall Street spotlight, once again, was on ‘s latest M&A commentary on Thursday as the conglomerate discussed its . As M&A chatter swirls around such sector players as Paramount Global, president Michael Cavanagh, a former banker who noted that he has been with the company for nearly 10 years now, once again signaled a core focus on investments in existing businesses with upside rather than potential acquisitions. “The idea of taking our well-generated capital across our businesses and, first and foremost, investing them back in the business with a very long-term view of what the future can be, where there’s expected return – whether that’s the parks business, whether that’s the broadband network, whether that’s streaming, whether it’s just broad innovation – I think it’s in our DNA” at this point, the Comcast executive emphasized during the earnings call. Management’s focus in on figuring out “ways to invest wisely for the future, while at the same time maintaining a very strong balance sheet,” he explained. “And we like the way the balance sheet is set up. When you go through these long, long arcs of change across industries with disruption, it allows you to sleep better at night, knowing the strength of the balance sheet we have.” In addition to those two priorities, Cavanagh highlighted capital returns to shareholders. “Not many companies are inclined to manage those three priorities as much as we are, and I can commit to that,” the Comcast president concluded. “That’s where our head is as we look forward to the next 10 years ahead.” Asked by an analyst about potential investments in gaming and other growth sectors and areas, Cavanagh said: “The success that we’ve had across parks and experiences lead us to plenty of opportunities to think about gaming and other other areas around live entertainment that go around and cross between our businesses. So we experiment with things... it’s our job to see if there are great opportunities to do that, but nothing to report today.” Given Comcast’s long history of big acquisitions, including the likes of NBCUniversal, cable giant AT&T Broadband and European pay-TV firm Sky, Wall Street observers have often kept eyes and ears open for possible signs of any involvement of the company in major M&A. Some investors and analysts have in the past expressed concern that Comcast could end up shelling out big bucks for assets on the block, and spend time and energy on integrating them. “While there may be speculation what we could do next, I’d like you to hear it directly from me. I love the company we have,” Roberts had in late January about a possible Warner Bros. Discovery combination. “So the bar continues to be even higher for us to do anything.” Speculation over a potential NBCUniversal-Paramount Global merger was also previously raised when Comcast unveiled an agreement to form the with Paramount in more than 20 European markets to roll out a joint streaming service.

       "  'content': 'European companies are falling behind their American counterparts in innovation and technology because of a “mindset issue,” says Nicolai Tangen, CEO of the $1.6 trillion Norges Bank Investment Management. In an , Tangen said there’s a gap in “the general level of ambition” between Europeans and Americans that has led to U.S. shares substantially outperforming their competitors across the Atlantic. “We are not very ambitious. I should be careful about talking about work-life balance, but the Americans just work harder,” he said. The Norwegian Sovereign Wealth Fund, the largest in the world, has — about 71% of which are in equities. Last quarter, the fund reported a record , boosted by its holdings in booming tech stocks like Microsoft, Apple, and Nvidia. U.S. shares make up almost half of all the fund’s equities portfolio, Tangen told the FT. That’s up from 32% in 2013. The U.K., in contrast, accounted for 6% of its equities, down from 15% a decade ago. The chasm in work-life balance between the U.S. and European countries is wide. The European Union, for example, has a mandated four-week paid vacation period across all 27 of its countries. Some countries also require additional paid days off on top of that required period. Meanwhile, in the U.S., nearly one-third of employees say to paid time off (PTO), according to a 2023 report. And those who do have PTO don’t always use it. The same report found that 765 million vacation days go unused by Americans each year. In 2022, an average of 1,811 hours for the year, while in the U.K people worked 1,532; in France they worked 1,511 hours, and in Germany people worked an annual average of 1,341 hours that year, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Another major difference between the two work cultures is the acceptance of business risks, especially when things go awry, Tangen told the FT. “You go bust in America, you get another chance,” he said. “In Europe, you’re dead.” 📬 Sign up for the Daily Brief Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.',\n",

Nearly one year after she filed for divorce from the Hughes, Bush tells on their new video series, \"We Need to Talk,\" why she decided to end their 13-month marriage. \"What\\'s interesting is that people think things came apart in the summer with my ex. I think that\\'s just when things became undeniable,\" Bush said. \"Something happened — and I will never talk about what it is because it doesn\\'t matter and it\\'s nobody\\'s business — but something happened in April of 2022,\" she explained. \"And I was this close to calling off my wedding. I was like, I am out.\" On Aug. 4, 2023, Bush filed for divorce from Hughes. The couple wed on June 11, 2022, at the Philbrook Museum of Art in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and Bush says she wasn\\'t sure whether or not she was going to walk down the aisle. \"You\\'re very used to your life being your individual life and you got to make space for somebody else,\" she said. However, after they wed, Bush says there was a moment when she realized their marriage just wasn\\'t working out. \"It got really easy to always have people over and to have a house filled with laughter,\" she said. \"But when I looked at my ex and said, \\'When was the last time you and I laughed alone together?\\' and we couldn\\'t answer the question, it was kind of like, what are we doing? And we started spending a lot of time apart.\" As for their divorce, Bush says she was going to go about it another way, but she soon changed her mind once she encountered a \"really hard\" situation that made her rethink her relationship with Hughes. \"The plan was not to say a lot to the world, but I discovered things through the summer that made the plan change,\" she said. Bush, who identifies as queer, is now in a relationship with former U.S. soccer player Ashlyn Harris, whom she met in 2019. In September 2023, Harris from her fellow soccer pro ex-wife, Ali Krieger, after nearly four years of marriage. While thinking about her relationship with Hughes, Bush says she tried hard to be a \"model wife\" and even forced herself to write a sweet tribute on Instagram for their one-year anniversary. \"I hit post. And then I walked into the bathroom and threw up,\" she recalled. Bush attributed her sad feelings to her having \"cold feet\" or maybe being doing \"too sensitive.\" \"Maybe this was the feeling you get when you settle down later in life and have to make space for another person,\" she said. However, Bush says she couldn\\'t deny that something was wrong. It became even more clear to her when she and Hughes tried to get pregnant. \"I was trying to get through months of endless ultrasounds, hormone shots, so many blood draws that I have scar tissue in my veins, and retrieval after retrieval, while simultaneously realizing the person I had chosen to be my partner didn’t necessarily speak the same emotional language I did,\" she said. Read on for more about Sophia Bush and Grant Hughes\\' relationship. Grant Hughes is an entrepreneur and real estate investor from Tulsa, Oklahoma. He loves to travel and has a passion for giving back, which connected him to Bush and her philanthropic endeavors, the pair told He attended the University of Oklahoma where he got a bachelor\\'s degree in business administration in entrepreneurship and venture management, per his . He also has a master\\'s degree in education from Loyola Marymount University. Additionally, Hughes has a master\\'s in business administration (MBA) in strategy, innovation, design thinking and a master\\'s in environment psychology and decision making from the University of Michigan. Hughes is a jack-of-all-trades. He the founder and CEO of Drink Good Wine, a company that sources curated wines for their members. He is also the owner and operator of BLRE Investments that invests in and operates real estate across the United States. Hughes is also part of a social book club based in Venice Beach, California. Prior to his current gigs and interests, he was a co-founder and chief strategy officer for , a “data-driven orthopedic recovery solutions to automatically assess and monitor pre- and post-operative patients, building the deep learning and diagnostic AI that will transform human recovery.” The pair met while on a New Year’s trip to Nicaragua about 10 years ago, per “We became fast friends but only saw each other a few times a year because both of us were traveling all of the time for work,” Bush told the magazine. In 2020, around the start of the pandemic, the two reconnected over books, philanthropic initiatives and sharing articles, per Vogue. They then began FaceTiming, which led to them dating. In a January 2021 Instagram post, hidden in a slideshow was a photo of the two wearing face masks. “Our first date was also our first Covid test,” Hughes wrote in his , describing the photo. The pair only made a handful of public appearances during their time together. On Oct. 2, 2021, they were all smiles at the Veuve Clicquot Polo Classic Los Angeles at Will Rogers State Historic Park Pacific Palisades, California. They were also photographed at the CAA kickoff party for the White House Correspondents Dinner in D.C. on April 29, 2022. Among their last public outing was at this year\\'s Elton John AIDS Foundation’s 31st annual Academy Awards viewing party on March 12. It wasn\\'t long before Grant popped the question. While on a trip to Lake Como, Italy, in August 2021, Hughes booked a sightseeing tour on a classic Riva boat for the two of them. During golden hour, he proposed to Bush. The two would later and their Instagram followers. “So it turns out that being your favorite person’s favorite person is the actual best feeling on planet Earth,” Bush wrote alongside the since-deleted Instagram photo, which showed Hughes kneeling down on one knee on the boat and placing a ring on her finger. In his own post on Instagram, Hughes also shared photos from their engagement. \"She is my forever Favorite. This is my favorite. And our life is that we’re building because she said \\'Yes\\' is already my favorite. I am SO EXCITED to do life with you, my love,\" Bush and Hughes on June 11, 2022, at the Philbrook Museum of Art in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

       "  'content': \"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court is taking up Donald Trump's bid to avoid prosecution over his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss to Democrat Joe Biden. Arguments are set to begin at 10 a.m. Trump's lawyers argue that former presidents are entitled to absolute immunity for their official acts. Otherwise, they say, politically motivated prosecutions of former occupants of the Oval Office would become routine and presidents couldn't function as the commander in chief if they had to worry about criminal charges. Lower courts have rejected those arguments, including a unanimous three-judge panel on an appeals court in Washington. And even if the high court resoundingly follows suit, the timing of its decision may be as important as the outcome. That's because Trump, the presumptive 2024 Republican presidential nominee, has been pushing to delay the trial until after the November election, and the later the justices issue their decision, the more likely he is to succeed. The court typically issues its last opinions by the end of June, which is roughly four months before the election. Currently: What to listen for during Supreme Court arguments on Donald Trump and presidential immunity The Supreme Court will decide whether Trump is immune from federal prosecution. Here's what's next What to know in the Supreme Court case about immunity for former President Trump Trump is in New York for the hush money trial while the Supreme Court hears his immunity case in DC Follow the AP's coverage of the U.S. Supreme Court at https://apnews.com/hub/us-supreme-court Here's the latest: TRUMP TAKES TO SOCIAL MEDIA BEFORE ARGUMENTS Shortly before arguments were slated to begin, Trump fired off a few posts Thursday on his social media network. In one, he declared in all caps, ''WITHOUT PRESIDENTIAL IMMUNITY, IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR A PRESIDENT TO PROPERLY FUNCTION, PUTTING THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IN GREAT AND EVERLASTING DANGER!'' Trump also said that without immunity, a president would just be ''ceremonial'' and the opposing political party ''can extort and blackmail the President by saying that, 'if you don't give us everything we want, we will Indict you for things you did while in Office,' even if everything done was totally Legal and Appropriate.'' EXPECT A FULL BENCH ON THE COURT Of the nine justices hearing the case, three were nominated by Trump — Amy Coney Barrett, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. But it's the presence of a justice confirmed decades before Trump's presidency, Justice Clarence Thomas, that's generated the most controversy. Thomas's wife, Ginni Thomas, urged the reversal of the 2020 election results and then attended the rally that preceded the Capitol riot. That has prompted calls for the justice to step aside from several court cases involving Trump and Jan. 6. But Thomas has ignored the calls, taking part in the unanimous court decision that found states cannot kick Trump off the ballot as well as last week's arguments over whether prosecutors can use a particular obstruction charge against Capitol riot defendants. COURT HAS MULTIPLE PATHS TO DECIDE THE CASE The justices will probably meet in private a short time after arguments to take a preliminary vote on the outcome. Chief Justice John Roberts would be a prime candidate to take on the opinion for the court, assuming he is in the majority. They could simply reject Trump's immunity claim outright, permitting the prosecution to move forward and returning the case to U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan to set a trial date. They could also reverse the lower courts by declaring for the first time that former presidents may not be prosecuted for conduct related to official acts during their time in office. Such a decision would stop the prosecution in its tracks. There are other options, too, including ruling that former presidents do retain some immunity for their official actions but that, wherever that line is drawn, Trump's actions fall way beyond it. Yet another possibility is that the court sends the case back to Chutkan with an assignment to decide whether the actions Trump is alleged to have taken to stay in power constitute official acts.\",\n",

       "  'content': 'David Schlosser bemoaned Safeway’s dearth of Passover supplies, but it may rest squarely in the hands on the current management and not a deliberate antisemitic move. I went to Safeway for an Easter ham and not only were the on sale hams sold out, but there was not a ham in the store. I am not religious and Easter for me is all about the ham and Peeps, and the closest thing to a religious experience for me would be finding any store that carries a foil-wrapped Farmer John ham. Humboldt County’s nonkosher residents don’t know what they’re missing. — Larry DePuy, Eureka I would urge you to call it what it is. It is an election interference case; calling it just a “hush money” case downplays the significance of his efforts, still ongoing, to subvert democracy. — Claire Perricelli, Eureka Donald Trump recently held a rally in Schnecksville, Pennsylvania where he referenced the Civil War battle of Gettysburg. I find his words cast doubt on his mental state. He begins, “What an unbelievable battle that was. It was so much, and so interesting, and so vicious and horrible, and so beautiful in so many different ways.” His statement is basically incoherent. Among other things, a normal person would never think to follow “vicious and horrible“ with “beautiful,” but Trump does. In fact, he even says the battle is beautiful in more ways than one. I’d love to know what they are. Trump continues, “Gettysburg, wow — I go to Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, to look and to watch.” Then he supposedly cites General Robert E. Lee: “Never fight uphill, me boys, never fight uphill. “ Unfortunately, this is not an actual quote, but rather Trump inventing one to likely reinforce his self-designated brilliance. I’m certain if President Biden had gone off this way, there would be major headlines everywhere questioning his mental competency. So where are those headlines for Trump? In closing, I offer Trump an actual Gettysburg quote that I hope he will find useful after Election Day: “This has been a sad day for us, Colonel, a sad day; but we can’t always expect to gain victories.” — Sherman Schapiro, Eureka I observed you supporting the Palestinian cause during the week of April 8 outside the county courthouse. I have several questions now. Can the United States act to protect and feed the people living in Israel’s Gaza Strip while also supporting Israel’s defense from attacks by Iran? Who would you like to see run the government of a future greater Palestine, which might govern both the Gaza and West Bank areas of Israel as currently constituted? Would you support a Palestinian government that calls for either the killing of Jews or the elimination of Israel as a sovereign nation? Are you in favor of creating a unified Palestinian nation-state that would exist on separate sides of Israel? Should the Israeli settlers within the West Bank be treated fairly and respectfully by a future Palestinian government? Should those Israeli citizens be allowed to have dual citizenship with both Israel and a future Palestinian nation? Would these Israelis maintain control over their settlements within the jurisdictional boundaries of a future Palestinian nation? Are you declining to support the one guy who might defeat the man who called for a Muslim travel ban and moved the American embassy to Jerusalem during his own presidency? What about the Hamas members; would you support a Palestinian constitution that bans them from ever holding government office? Would you agree to let Jerusalem remain wholly within Israel? I hope you promote peace for all the people of the Middle East. — Eugene Biggins, Indianola After its recent price increase, Tesla now wants $100,000 for its top-of-the-line Cybertruck. In the corporate equation, profit is the only constant. All of the other terms are variable. — Jeffrey L Bobbitt, Eureka I went fishing with my friend Joe last weekend. He is aware of my situation. I asked him how often his doctor checks his PSA level. He replied that it is checked every year with his routine blood test. My PSA on 1/26/2018 was 1.3, normal. FIVE+ YEARS LATER, THE NEXT TIME IT WAS CHECKED ON MAY 26, 2023 IT WAS 141. Prostate cancer. Further testing indicated that it was metastatic stage 4 cancer, a gruesome death sentence. Had it been checked annually, could it have been treated, yes. Would I have a future, yes. Do I have a future, no. We have done all that can be done at Stanford Heath. That being said, the Stanford oncologist gives me a life expectancy of 24 to 48 months. Checking your PSA is a simple blood test. If you are over the age of 60 you should insist, demand that your physician CHECK YOUR PSA EVERY YEAR! If they won’t, or don’t think it’s necessary, find someone who will do it. It’s your life. That way if there is a problem it can be treated and you, like Joe, will get to see your grandchildren graduate from high school.

       "  'description': 'Wilson landed with the Broncos on Monday after three turbulent seasons with the Jets.',\n",
       "  'content': 'Peyton Manning wasted no time welcoming new Broncos quarterback Zach Wilson to Denver following his trade from the Jets on Monday. When discussing the Broncos’ recent acquisition on-air with Denver Sports , the two-time Super Bowl champion — who played in Denver for four seasons after beginning his prolific career in Indianapolis in 1998 — revealed he reached out to Wilson, who “sounds excited to be here.” “I’ve never met Zach, but I got his number [Monday] from the Broncos and reached out to him and welcomed him to Denver and was excited with this new chapter,” Manning told Josh Dover and Brandon Stokley. As Peyton Manning told @bstokley14 & @JoshuaDover , he reached out to Zach Wilson after the Broncos traded for him. Manning believes NYJ’s offensive instability hurt Wilson: “The best way to really screw a young quarterback up is to change coordinators on him every single year.” pic.twitter.com/nPGDCjMaHW “He sounds excited to be here, so hopefully it’ll be a good fit.” Manning, who retired from the NFL after the 2015 season, when he won a Super Bowl with Denver, believes the “change of scenario” for Wilson “is going to be a good one” following three rocky seasons in New York coupled with a revolving door of offensive coordinators. “I don’t know how many coordinators he had in the time he was there, it was at least two, it might have been three, so, as you know, for a young quarterback, the best way to really I think screw a young quarterback up is to change coordinators on him every single year, and it drives me crazy,” Manning said. “Look, I was very fortunate. I had an old-school coach named Tom Moore who was the coordinator the entire time I was there in Indianapolis. Tom Brady had different coordinators [with the Patriots], Charlie Weis, Josh McDaniels, Bill O’Brien. But it was the same system, right? [Head coach Bill] Belichick said, hey, we’re running the same exact system. So it’s the same language, right? It’s the same verbiage. You rep each play against different coverages and you just learn those plays with the reps.” Upon being drafted by the Jets second overall in 2021, Wilson teamed up with Mike LaFleur, the brother of Packers head coach Matt LaFleur. He departed the team after two seasons and the Jets added former Broncos head coach — and ex-Packers offensive coordinator — Nathaniel Hackett in January 2023. Hackett previously worked with four-time league MVP Aaron Rodgers, whom the Jets acquired last April from Green Bay. Wilson, 24, was expected to back up Rodgers, 40, last year before the latter ruptured his Achilles just four plays into his Jets career. Wilson would finish his final year with the Jets throwing for 2,271 yards, eight touchdowns and seven interceptions through 12 games. Manning, 48, believes a “reboot” under second-year Broncos coach Sean Payton will serve Wilson well. “Let’s just sort of start over, right? And let’s just let Sean Payton and his staff coach you and kind of start from ground zero, which I think might be just what Zach needs,” the five-time NFL MVP said, per Denver Sports. The Broncos are coming off an 8-9 campaign and released Super Bowl champion quarterback Russell Wilson in March following a failed two-year experiment. It’s been widely speculated Denver could add a quarterback in the first round of the 2024 NFL Draft on Thursday, with the team said to be interested in Oregon’s Bo Nix. The Broncos currently hold the No. 12 overall pick in the first round. They added a seventh-rounder (No. 256) from the Jets as part of the Wilson trade.',\n",

       "  'content': 'WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. Supreme Court is taking up Donald Trump’s bid to avoid prosecution over his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss to Democrat Joe Biden. Arguments are set to begin at 10 a.m. Trump’s lawyers argue that former presidents are entitled to absolute immunity for their official acts. Otherwise, they say, politically motivated prosecutions of former occupants of the Oval Office would become routine and presidents couldn’t function as the commander in chief if they had to worry about criminal charges. Lower courts have rejected those arguments, including a unanimous three-judge panel on an appeals court in Washington. And even if the high court resoundingly follows suit, the timing of its decision may be as important as the outcome. That’s because Trump, the presumptive 2024 Republican presidential nominee, has been pushing to delay the trial until after the November election, and the later the justices issue their decision, the more likely he is to succeed.

Currently: What to listen for during Supreme Court arguments on Donald Trump and presidential immunity The Supreme Court will decide whether Trump is immune from federal prosecution. Here’s what’s next What to know in the Supreme Court case about immunity for former President Trump Trump is in New York for the hush money trial while the Supreme Court hears his immunity case in DC Follow the AP’s coverage of the U.S. Supreme Court at https://apnews.com/hub/us-supreme-court Here’s the latest: Shortly before arguments were slated to begin, Trump fired off a few posts Thursday on his social media network. In one, he declared in all caps, “WITHOUT PRESIDENTIAL IMMUNITY, IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR A PRESIDENT TO PROPERLY FUNCTION, PUTTING THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IN GREAT AND EVERLASTING DANGER!” Trump also said that without immunity, a president would just be “ceremonial” and the opposing political party “can extort and blackmail the President by saying that, ‘if you don’t give us everything we want, we will Indict you for things you did while in Office,’ even if everything done was totally Legal and Appropriate.” Of the nine justices hearing the case, three were nominated by Trump — Amy Coney Barrett, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. But it’s the presence of a justice confirmed decades before Trump’s presidency, Justice Clarence Thomas, that’s generated the most controversy. Thomas’s wife, Ginni Thomas, urged the reversal of the 2020 election results and then attended the rally that preceded the Capitol riot. That has prompted calls for the justice to step aside from several court cases involving Trump and Jan. 6. But Thomas has ignored the calls, taking part in the unanimous court decision that found states cannot kick Trump off the ballot as well as last week’s arguments over whether prosecutors can use a particular obstruction charge against Capitol riot defendants. The justices will probably meet in private a short time after arguments to take a preliminary vote on the outcome. Chief Justice John Roberts would be a prime candidate to take on the opinion for the court, assuming he is in the majority. They could simply reject Trump’s immunity claim outright, permitting the prosecution to move forward and returning the case to U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan to set a trial date. They could also reverse the lower courts by declaring for the first time that former presidents may not be prosecuted for conduct related to official acts during their time in office. Such a decision would stop the prosecution in its tracks. There are other options, too, including ruling that former presidents do retain some immunity for their official actions but that, wherever that line is drawn, Trump’s actions fall way beyond it. Yet another possibility is that the court sends the case back to Chutkan with an assignment to decide whether the actions Trump is alleged to have taken to stay in power constitute official acts.',\n",

       "  'content': 'To try and decide each week where and what to eat around the basin can be a challenge – there are so many amazing choices. In this feature we’ll dive into dishes that will surely satisfy those hunger pangs and leave you wondering where to go next. I don’t know about you, but I love the time of year when restaurants that have seasonal menus changeover to the summer season. Whether it’s the freshness of the produce or those light and tangy flavors, summer cuisine seems to match the season more so than any other. This week’s feature is a good example. To start, the house made chipotle glaze is created by adobo peppers getting reduced in a bath of water and spices until tightened up and the flavors deepen. That gets brushed on the fresh salmon before getting a hard sear. The glaze continues to get applied to the salmon throughout the searing process before ultimately getting finished off under the broiler to give the exterior a slight caramelization. The fish is placed upon a bed of cilantro lime rice and garlic sautéed spinach before ultimately getting finished off with a scratch made pineapple salsa, which marinates overnight. Once the dish hits the table, you get a strong sense of smell from all the ingredients. And I know for some people, chipotle can feel a bit heavy-handed, but not here. While the chipotle flavor does provide a little heat, it is balanced out by the sweetness of the pineapple salsa. The rice also has a little creaminess feel that calms down any fears of the heat being too much for the palette. The salmon itself is equal parts flaky and moist and grabbing a bite that includes the spinach, feels about as healthy as any dish could. Picture a doctor with an apple in one hand and broccoli in the other and that’s the kind of healthy I’m thinking of. Now open for dinner, you have multiple options to grab this dish. Depending on when you visit, this menu item has been a special on Saturdays, but will be a part of the restaurant’s summer menu given its popularity. It’s easy to see why. Go see for yourself. Zephyr Cove Restaurant is located at 760 Hwy 50 in Zephyr Cove. For more information visit them online at zephyrcove.com/dining/zephyr-cove-restaurant/ or reach them by phone at 775-589-4906.',\n",

       "  'content': 'A New Jersey couple has been convicted of luring two women, both of them undocumented immigrants, to the United States and , officials announced. Bolaji Bolarinwa of two counts of forced labor, one count of alien harboring for financial gain, and two counts of document servitude, the U.S. Attorney’s Office District of New Jersey said in a release on Wednesday. Her husband, Isiaka Bolarinwa, was also convicted of two counts of forced labor and one count of alien harboring for financial gain. The Bolarinwas, U.Sc citizens born in Nigeria and living in Burlington County, of a life and an education in the United States, and instead subjected them to grueling hours, physical abuse and psychological abuse,” U.S. Attorney Philip Sellinger said. “ and human trafficking are abhorrent crimes that have no place in our society, and I am grateful to our team of prosecutors, agents and support staff for ensuring that justice was done in this case,” he added. The first victim , investigators said. Upon her arrival, Bolaji Bolarinwa stole her passport and forced her into servitude with threats against both her and her daughter. She also subjected the woman to verbal abuse, isolation and constant surveillance in a bid to keep her working “every day, around the clock for nearly a year,” according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office. It noted Isiaka was aware of his wife’s actions and “directly benefited” from the forced labor. Their traveled to the United States in April 2016 on a student visa. Bolaji similarly nabbed her passport and coerced her into performing household work and childcare. In this instance however, she relied “heavily on physical abuse.” Investigators added that Isiaka again directly benefited from her cooking, cleaning and childcare, and that he also abused the victim on at least one occasion. The women remained trapped with the Bolarinwas until October 2016, when the second victim asked her college professor for help. The educator notified the FBI. “Imagine showing up in a foreign land, hoping for a better life and ending up trapped with no place to go and no one to turn to for help,” said Special Agent in Charge James E. Dennehy of the FBI Newark Field Office. “The victims in this investigation suffered in unimaginable ways at the hands of their captors, enduring years of physical and mental abuse.” He added: “Human trafficking often takes on many different forms and can hide in plain sight.” Both suspects face a maximum of 20 years in prison for each forced labor count, and up to 10 years in prison for the alien harboring count. Bolaji is also facing a five years in prison for each unlawful document conduct count. The couple will also be required to pay mandatory restitution to the two victims and each face a fine on each count of up to $250,000 or twice the gross gain or gross loss from the offense, whichever is greatest.',\n",
